<p>Welcome to EBible Fellowship’s Bible study in the Book of Genesis. This is study #6 of Genesis, chapter 2 and we are going to read Genesis 2:6-7:</p>

<p class="verse">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. And JEHOVAH God formed man *of* the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</p> 

<p>As we have been going verse by verse in the Book of Genesis, we have seen that God has been describing the literal creation and the beginning of all things. This is the historical record of the beginning of the earth. Forget what many scientists today say and forget what schools teach concerning evolution and the <em>“Big Bang.”</em> It is all nonsense that has come forth from the minds of men. Here is the truthful and faithful record from the One who knows and the One who created the world and created man. It is God who cannot lie and He is giving us the record. These are the events as they unfolded and as God brought it to pass. We know this. We know this is true history and it is extremely helpful to know that these things are true.  Man was made in God’s image and God is our Father, as He called their name <em>“Adam,”</em> and so forth. It is helpful to know the historical elements of the things of creation. It does involve moral teaching, but of supreme importance to God is the deeper spiritual meaning of the events He is relaying to us. God gave this information to Moses thousands of years after creation, but it was given as a perfect account with no mistake of any kind and God’s ultimate purpose of giving the Bible is to teach the Gospel, spiritual truth.</p>  

<p>It says in Genesis 2:6:</p>

<p class="verse">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</p>

<p>Because verse 5 said that JEHOVAH God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, there are some theologians that think there was no rain for a long period of time. Some people even speculate that the flood in the days of Noah was the first rain. Of course, that is impossible.  Here, God is telling us that He put the same process into place at the very beginning and since verse 7 speaks of the creation of man it was in the first week of creation that God caused this mist to go up from the earth and the whole face of the ground was watered. That is exactly the same process we have in place today when it rains.  It is the distillation process.</p>

<p>As we read this word <em>“mist,”</em> it is Strong’s #108 and it is only found one other place in the Old Testament and that is in Job 36:26-28:</p>

<p class="verse">Behold, God <em>is</em> great, and we know <em>him</em> not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: Which the clouds do drop <em>and</em> distil upon man abundantly.</p> 

<p>Here, the Lord is describing the process of causing it to rain. He makes drops of water small and they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof. The English word <em>“vapour”</em> is a translation of the same Hebrew word that was translated as <em>“mist”</em> in Genesis 2, verse 6. So, according to the midst thereof the rain falls upon the earth and it drops and distils upon man abundantly. That is exactly how rain occurs today. God is telling us that <em>“there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.”</em> The vapour went up into the clouds and at a certain point the clouds poured down rain, just like they do today. So we know there was rain early on and this would have been necessary for the plants to grow, the flowers to bloom and the fruit to come forth. God caused it to rain and it was not just a section of ground, but He watered the entire face of the ground. In those days of perfection, there would have been no drought anywhere. Everything would have been in perfect operating condition and the water would have fallen on the earth in every area. In our cursed world today we have some areas that get an abundance of rain and, often, it is more than they need and other areas do not get enough rain. There is uneven rainfall in different parts of the earth, but that was not the case at that time. Everything worked exactly as it was designed in the original creation and all was “good.”</p>  

<p>However, we are interested in the spiritual truth of these things. Notice that as God goes into more detail concerning the mist, it says in Job 36:27:</p>

<p class="verse">For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</p>

<p>The word <em>“drops”</em> is Strong’s #5198 and it is only found one other time, but it is very closely related to Strong’s #5197. They have the same consonants and they almost have identical vowel pointing with only one slight difference. Strong’s #5197 is translated as <em>“dropped”</em> in Job 29:22:</p>

<p class="verse">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</p> 

<p>Job is speaking and it had said in verse 1 of this chapter that Job <em>“continued his parable.”</em> Job is a type of Christ and the whole Book of Job is a historical parable pointing to the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ. So when Job refers to his speech that <em>“dropped upon them,”</em> it goes on to say in Job 29:23:</p>

<p class="verse">And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide <em>as</em> for the latter rain.</p> 

<p>Job is a picture of Christ and Christ is the Word and His Word drops upon man as the rain. That is the point God makes in Isaiah 55:10-11:</p>

<p class="verse">For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper <em>in the thing</em> whereto I sent it.</p> 

<p>God said, <em>“For as the rain cometh down…so shall my word be,”</em> and that is what it said in Job 29:22:</p>

<p class="verse">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</p> 

God used that word <em>“drop”</em> to refer to the small drops of rain. It is not coincidental. It is not accidental. God is the one that intricately designed this creation. God intricately designed man. God is a brilliant God and He forms things of complex design, so He also formed the Bible so that when we find words in one part of the Bible we will find consistency with another part of the Bible. There will be a connection and there will be harmony like pieces of a puzzle. So the rain ties in with the Word of God and the dropping of the rain points to the sending forth of the Word of God.</p>

<p>The same Hebrew word, Strong’s #5197, is found in Amos 9:13:</p>

<p class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith JEHOVAH, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</p>

Here, it refers to wine, but the word <em>“drop”</em> points to the same thing.  It points to the Word of God, the Gospel.  It also says in Amos 7:16:</p>

<p class="verse">Now therefore hear thou the word of JEHOVAH: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not *thy word* against the house of Isaac.</p>

<p>This is what theologians call Hebrew parallelism, where God makes a statement in the first part of the verse and then He says it again in a synonymous way in the second part of the verse.  Here, it says, <em>“Prophesy not against Israel,”</em> and this carries the same meaning as the statement, <em>“And drop not they word against the house of Isaac.”</em>  To <em>“prophesy”</em> and to <em>“drop not thy word”</em> are synonyms, so to prophesy means to drop the Word like the rain. This same word <em>“drop”</em> is translated as <em>“prophesy”</em> three times in Micah 2:6:</p>

<p class="verse">Prophesy ye not, <em>say they to them that</em> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <em>that</em> they shall not take shame.</p> 

<p>The people that are not God’s people want God’s people to stop prophesying. When God opened up information about the end of the church age, those that refused to leave the churches said, <em>“Do not say that. Prophesy not.”</em> When God opened up information about the shutting of the door of heaven on May 21, 2011, there were all kinds of people that said, <em>“Do not dare say that. Prophesy not.”</em> To prophesy means to declare whatever truth the Bible declares, so here the word <em>“prophesy”</em> is the same word as the word <em>“drop”.</em></p>

<p>It says in Micah 2:11:</p>

<p class="verse">If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <em>saying</em>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</p>

<p>The word <em>“prophesy”</em> and the word <em>“prophet”</em> in this verse are both Strong’s #5197. So it could literally be the <em>“dropper of this people”</em> or the one that drops the Word of God. It relates to the Word that comes down from above and that is why “rain” is such a good picture of the Word of God. It is water and it falls from above. When you are outside standing in the rain, there is no shower head above, but you look up and you can just see the sky and, yet, water is falling down upon you. It is a good illustration of the Word of God because the Word of God comes down from above to the earth where men dwell. God’s Word falls as the rain and it accomplishes the purpose God sent it forth to do in the spiritual realm in the hearts of men. In the day of salvation God’s Word wrought salvation. In the Day of Judgment God’s Word brings the wrath of God and that also is a purpose God would have it to accomplish.</p>

<p>Let us go back to Genesis 2:6:</p>

<p class="verse">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</p>

<p>This is another picture of God sending the Gospel. It falls on the dust of the ground. Then it goes on to say in Genesis 2:7:</p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH God formed man <em>of</em> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</p>

<p>This week there was a caller who had an interesting thought about connecting verse 6 and verse 7, spiritually, and we can see how they would be related. First the rain falls and waters the face of the ground. What is the next thing we read? JEHOVAH God formed man of the dust of the ground. Man rose up from the ground that had received the water. It is a picture of the Word of God forming or creating the new man.  Adam was a new man. Adam was created good and Adam being a new creature without sin could be a type and picture of Christ, but he could also be a picture of the people that God would save. When the Word of God goes forth and accomplishes salvation in a person it creates a new heart and a new spirit and God calls this person a “new creature,” in 2Corinthians, chapter 5. The saved person becomes a new creation in Christ and without sin, because in the resurrected soul of the child of God there is no more sin.  There is no evil of any kind. It is a new creation within the soul existence of the sinner that had the atoning work of Jesus Christ applied to him.</p>  

<p>We can look at it this way in regard to individuals, but, collectively, the formation of Adam as a result of the rain could point to the entire body of Christ. All of God’s elect that did become saved form that one body of the Lord Jesus Christ. How did they become saved? God speaks of His program of <em>“times and seasons”</em> or His periods of <em>“rain.”</em> The rain is the sending forth of water from heaven. There was the early righteous rain in the Old Testament. There was the early rain that fell during the church age to produce the firstfruits. Finally, there was the Latter Rain that fell during the second part of the Great Tribulation to form the great multitude. When you put it all together, it is all of God’s elect that have experienced <em>“rain”</em> and are brought forth as fruit. Therefore, they were formed into that one body as a result of the rain, the falling down of the Word of God from heaven to the earth. So this idea is very cohesive: <em>“But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. And JEHOVAH God formed man of the dust of the ground.”</em></p>

<p>The word <em>“formed”</em> in verse 7 is also used in Isaiah 43:1:</p>

<p class="verse">But now thus saith JEHOVAH that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called <em>thee</em> by thy name; thou <em>art</em> mine.</p>

<p>Then it says in Isaiah 43:5-7:</p>

<p class="verse">Fear not: for I <em>am</em> with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; <em>Even</em> every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.</p> 

<p>This is referring to Jacob or to the elect of God. They were formed by God, just as it says of the formation of man: <em>“And JEHOVAH God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</em></p>

<p>We do not have time in this study, but, Lord willing, we will look at that word <em>“breathed.”</em> God breathed into man’s nostrils and gave him life and that is how man became a living soul. We will find that this also ties into God’s salvation program.</p>
