<p>Welcome to EBible Fellowship’s Bible study in the Book of Genesis.  This is study #7 of Genesis, chapter 5 and we are looking at Genesis 5:9-11:</p>

<p><strong>And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.</strong></p>

<p>At this point God is presenting another aspect to the calendar.  We have seen that from Adam to Seth and from Seth to Enos there were immediate father/son relationships, but here God introduces a later descendant from Enos, who is Cainan, and he will be the calendar reference patriarch.  It will not go to Enos’ immediate son, but it will go through Cainan who is a later descendant of Enos and Cainan will not be born until the year Enos would die.  Again, this results in a calendar that gives us a far greater number of years than the calendar of Bishop Ussher or the accepted calendar of the corporate church and which many church theologians have accepted as an accurate calendar of history, but it is not.  Their calendar is incorrect.</p>

<p>The accurate calendar is what we have seen up this point up and until God gives us further notice of a change in methodology for tracking time.  Later on God will begin to work (again) through father and son for a short period of time before transitioning once more to the idea of later descendants.</p>

<p>So, here it says in Genesis 5:9:</p>

<p><strong>And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:</strong></p>

<p>Let us just look at the numbers the Lord give us.  The number <em>“90”</em> is <em>“3 x 3 x 3 x 10”</em> and the number <em>“10”</em> indicates completeness.  When Enos was 90 years old, he <em>“begat”</em> Cainan, but the way God had concealed the actual calendar by leading the reader to assume that Cainan was born when Enos was 90 years old and that is not correct.  That is an error that Bishop Ussher’s calendar contained, as well as other similar calendars.  That is the trap and the snare that God set for the reader because we immediately think that <em>“begat”</em> means <em>“born”</em> and that Cainan was born when Enos was 90 years old.   Look at it this way.  Let us say that Enos had three sons.  Cainan would not come from all three sons, but he would come from one of the three sons.  Let us just make up a name and say that Enos was 90 years old and he had his third son named John.  Then John would have children and John’s children would have children and one of John’s grandchildren would be Cainan.  Cainan is not the son of the other two sons of Enos, but he is a descendant of John who was born to Enos when Enos was 90 years old.  Now we can understand why God says that Enos was 90 years old and begat Cainan because Cainan will come from the son born to Enos when Enos was 90.</p>

<p>God also wrote it this way to lead people astray, as He does in numerous ways in the Bible.  God will allow the person reading to make a false assumption that will lead them away from truth and He does this with doctrine.  For example, when people read, <em>“Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,”</em> many think, <em>“Oh, I just believe on the Lord Jesus and I will be saved.”</em>  People quickly make these wrong assumptions.  It is how God wrote the Bible.</p>

<p>Of course, at this late stage of earth’s history when there has been much teaching after God opened the Scriptures to more and more truth and the Word of God covered the earth as the waters cover the sea, the great majority of God’s people are aware of how God wrote the Bible.  However, there are as many as 2 billion church goers that are ignorant of how God wrote the Bible and that God is a God that hides Himself and wrote the Bible as a giant parable.  He hid truth, like buried treasure, in all the Scriptures, and the churches are under the delusion that the Bible is an easy Book to understand and, therefore, God has confounded them on practically ever doctrine they hold.  But, as far as God’s elect that are familiar with the Word of God, they have become familiar with God’s method of laying out His genealogies in the Book of Genesis that will be the groundwork of the Biblical calendar of history.</p>

<p>It is like watching a magician perform a magic trick, as he directs your eye to his left hand while his right hand is doing something you are not observing.  Likewise, God is directing the mind’s eye to the statement that Enos was 90 and begat Cainan and the reader draws a conclusion that is not correct and, yet, if you follow the <em>“illusion,”</em> as it were, it goes on to say in Genesis 5:10:</p>

<p><strong>And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:</strong></p>

<p>Again, the number <em>“815”</em> does not really lead us anywhere, but we can look at the number itself and it breaks down to <em>“5 x 163,”</em> and as far as I am aware, the number <em>“163”</em> is either not significant or we are still lacking understanding of its spiritual meaning.  Also, the number <em>“815”</em> does not get added into the calendar.  The “90” years was not what we were to look at, but a misdirection.  However, it is the next number that is significant, as it says in Genesis 5:11:</p>

<p><strong>And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.</strong></p>

<p>Here is our number.  Spiritually, it breaks down to <em>“5 x 181,”</em> with the number <em>“5”</em> pointing to the atonement and the number <em>“181”</em> does not have any significance that we understand presently.  But as far as the Biblical calendar of history, the number <em>“905”</em> is the important number, which is the combination of the numbers “90” and <em>“815”</em> and the number <em>“905”</em> is the number that is added to our calendar.  From creation to Adam, there were 130 years as the first calendar reference.  Then Seth was born that year and he was 105 when he begat Enos, an immediate son, so when the world was 235 years old (130 +105) Enos was born and now we are told the lifespan of Enos was 905 years.  As we are laying out the calendar we add 905 years to the number 235 and it totals 1140.  When Enos died at age 905 it was the year 1140 from creation.  At this point we are not going to tie it into the date of creation of 11,013BC.  We are just looking at the timeline from Adam and how far we can take it down through history.  Once we have the timeline all worked out we will make the attempt to align it with our own calendar and we will see how that can be done, but that is for a future study.  Right now we are just following the Bible’s calendar and at this point back in history it is year 1140 from the creation of the world.</p>

<p>Enos died in that year that was 1140 years from creation.  Adam, who lived to be 930, died about 100 years earlier.  In this year that is 1140 years from creation, Cainan is born and he is the fourth generation from Adam: Adam, Seth, Enos and Cainan.  Cainan was born in the year 1140.  Then it says in Genesis 5:12-14:</p>

<p><strong>And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel: And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.</strong></p>

<p>This format is very similar to what we read in verses 9 through 11 regarding the line from Enos to Cainan.  Now God is making very similar statements, as He says, <em>“And Cainan lived seventy years,”</em> and the number <em>“70”</em> would be <em>“7 x 10,”</em> with the number <em>“7”</em> pointing to perfection and the number <em>“10”</em> pointing to completion.  We are going to find that all the numbers in this section are interesting numbers that have spiritual significance that we do understand.  Cainan then begat Mahalaleel when he was 70 years old.  Was Mahalaleel born that that time?  No, he was not, but notice that God said he had sons and daughters.  Cainan had a wife that gave birth to a son and let us just give him the name of Joseph (I am just making that name up.)  Let us say that Cainan had a son named Joseph and let us say that he was son #1 of a dozen sons and Cainan would go on to have another 11 children, but Mahalaleel would be a descendant of Joseph, the son that Cainan had when he was 70 years old.  Mahalaleel is not a descendant of any of the other 11 sons.  Do you see how it works?  Do you see what God is saying when He said, <em>“And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel”?</em>  In his 70th year, Cainan begat a son who would eventually through his line have a descendant that could be a grandson or a great grandson, and so forth, but it would be in a line that could be traced back to the son Cainan had when he was 70 years old.  That is how God is able to make this statement and have it be a perfectly correct statement because God uses the word <em>“begat”</em> to apply to either an immediate son or to a later descendant, just like Christ was said to be the son of David; Christ was not a direct son, but a son many hundreds of years later in the lineage of David.  That is what is going on in our verses in Genesis.  Then it goes on to say in Genesis 5:13:</p>

<p><strong>And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:</strong></p>

<p>Cainan lived 70 years and begat the son that Mahalaleel would come from and then God gives us the number <em>“840,”</em> which is <em>“10 x 84,”</em> and the number <em>“84”</em> is a number that identifies with the Great Tribulation, which was 8,400 days in length (23 years).  The three and one half days the two witnesses were lying dead in the streets was 84 hours, and so forth.</p>

<p>Why do I give you the numbers?  It is because I find it helpful to jot them down and even if we do not have an understanding of the spiritual meaning at this point, at a later time when we are looking at another passage and it leads us back to this earlier Scripture and it could be helpful for another passage you are studying.</p>

<p>But, again, the 840 years is not what gets added to the Biblical calendar, just like the 70 years is not what is added, but it is the combination of those two numbers (70 + 840) that gives us the final total in Genesis 5:14:</p>

<p><strong>And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.</strong></p>

<p>Again, the number <em>“910”</em> is a very interesting number, spiritually.  It can be broken down to <em>“7 x 10 x 13.”</em>  The number <em>“7”</em> is perfection; the number “10” is completeness; and the number <em>“13”</em> points to the end of the world.  Put together with the reference to the number <em>“840,”</em> we can certainly see that God is relating this particular Biblical calendar patriarch Cainan in some way to the Great Tribulation and in some way to the end of the world, based on the numbers He used.  So the numbers <em>“70”</em> and <em>“840”</em> and <em>“910”</em> are all significant and can be tied into the time of the end.  Remember the number <em>“70”</em> is <em>“7 x 10”</em> and from the flood, it was 7,000 years, which is the number <em>“7”</em> together with multiples of 10 that takes us to the beginning of Judgment Day, May 21, 2011.</p>

<p>Again, at this point we have limited information about Cainan and the individual he begat (Mahalaleel) and we may not be able to fully understand the spiritual picture, but the numbers are interesting and, perhaps, they will be helpful at some point.</p>

<p>As far as the timeline, when Enos died it was the year 1140 and then God tells us that Cainan was born in that year and now he has lived his life and it was 910 years long and then he died.  Again, all the lifetime of Cainan the calendar was tied to him.  Just as the flood came in Noah’s 600th year, if any event was of importance to the people of that time, it would have been identified with his lifespan.  When Cainan died at the age of 910 it was the year 2050 from creation.  We take our previous number 1140 and add 910 and we come to 2050 years from the creation of the world.  Until this point in Genesis 5, verse 14 when the Lord tells us, <em>“And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died,”</em> the world was 2050 years old.  That is a pretty long period of time.  We are currently in the year 2016AD, but we are actually 2,022 years from the actual birth of Christ in 7BC.  We can look back in our present time all the way back to the birth of Christ and it seems like a tremendously long period of time to us.  Time has not changed.  A day is still 24 hours and a lunar month is still 29.530 days and a year is still 365.2422 days, so they lived 2050 years from creation to the time of Cainan’s death.  The Old Testament history is really just getting under way – we have not even gotten to the time of the flood, which would not happen until over 6,000 years of history, so there are almost 4,000 years to go until we even reach the flood, which is ancient history to us today.  But this is the timeline that God established for Old Testament history and it was quite a long span of time.  It necessarily had to be so man could populate the earth and events could unfold according to God’s timetable.</p>

<p>We are really given a special privilege and it is a blessing that we can have the accurate calendar and the accurate timeline for the history of this world.  It is not only a blessing that God has given us this information, but that we are allowed to recognize it and understand it, especially since we live in a world that is willfully ignorant of it.  They desire not to know it and they would rather have their fanciful ideas of billions of years of evolution, so they can put the idea of creation as far away from them as possible.  They are under some sort of delusion that if they say something is billions and billions of years old, it somehow answers the question of where everything came from, but it does not.  It is just hiding the problem and ignoring the insurmountable difficulty of dealing with where everything came from and they just push it so far back that they think no one will think to ask the question.</p>

<p>That is not a problem with the child of God.  By God’s grace, we have been granted the understanding to see the correct timeline for the history of the world and it is really something for which we are very thankful.</p>
