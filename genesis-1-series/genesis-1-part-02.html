<p>Welcome to EBible Fellowship’s Bible study in the Book of Genesis. This is study #2 of Genesis, chapter 1 and I will read Genesis 1:1-5:</p>
<p class="verse">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness <em>was</em> upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that <em>it was</em> good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</p> 
</p>

<p>I will stop reading there. We were looking at verse 1:</p>

<p class="verse">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>

<p>This statement goes contrary to practically all schools and colleges today. They teach that the origin of all things came about through a <em>“Big Bang.”</em> They are not clear on this, but many hold to the idea that there was an explosion of <em>“something”</em> that they are unclear about, but it was billions of years ago. It exploded and the universe formed and planet Earth formed.</p>  

<p>They say that the earth is billions of years old. Even if we were to take that idea about how the world began, you still have the question of <em>“life”</em> because the planets, the stars, the sun, the moon and earth would lack <em>“life.”</em> The theory continues to say that over billions of years life developed. Even though they do not directly say this, they are saying that life developed from non-life or that things that are alive came from things that were not alive and then there was an early form of life. Can you imagine that this idea has not only been accepted as a legitimate theory, but it has been accepted (for the most part) as the actual origin of everything?  It has been accepted by governments and institutions of learning and this is the theory they teach as <em>“fact”</em> and they teach students at a very early age that the universe came from the <em>“Big Bang”</em> and then life slowly began to form. They say that there was some early form of small life, like bacteria (or whatever it was), and it began to grow and develop into all the life forms we see today. How ridiculous! In fact, <em>“ridiculous”</em> is not even a sufficient word to describe the absurdity and foolishness of this entire idea.</p>

<p>How can intelligent people actually hold onto this kind of idea? Well, there is only one reason that mankind can hold to this idea. It is because the only other option for <em>“life”</em> is God and fallen mankind does not want God. They want to be their own gods and their own determiners of right and wrong. They want to be independent agents that operate without a Creator and they prefer the idea that they came from <em>“nothing”</em> and life is purposeless and meaningless. They do not want to be responsible to a Creator and to do the will and commandments of that Creator. It is the last thing the natural-minded person would want, so they are very prejudiced. This prejudice is a deep-down desire to flee away from God and to come out from under the restraints of His commandments and will. It has blinded mankind and in this particular area it has caused man to operate in a very foolish way because he cannot honestly look at the other option which says, <em>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”</em></p>

<p>It says in Romans 1:18-22:</p>

<p class="verse">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <em>it</em> unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <em>even</em> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <em>him</em> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p> 

<p>The world writes all sorts of textbooks that confidently affirm the origins of the universe over billions of years and it speaks of man’s ancestors coming from these early stages of life billions of years ago and developing to our present forms. It is complete and utter foolishness, although it is not presented that way. It is presented as the wise conclusions of scientists that have, supposedly, figured this out. They say that 13.7 billion years ago is when it all began and a small particle, like an electron, exploded and all this universe and life came to pass.</p>

<p>We look around and we see the complex design of each human being and of the various animals and birds and insects and all the wonderful plant life. They can put these things under a microscope and see the complexity of all these creatures and the DNA shows such a complex design. And we look up into the heavens and we see a perfectly positioned sun in relationship to the earth and it is at exactly the right position for life to be maintained. If the sun were any closer, we would be burned up and if it were any farther away we would freeze. We see the stars set in their courses. And mankind determines that it all came to pass through random chance and it all just fell into place and, yet, we do not see evidence of randomness, but we see a very definite pattern in all things. We see formation and we see the handiwork of a Creator. We see the hand of God in everything around us, from our own bodies to our pet dogs and even the flea on the dog.  In everything visible, we see the <em>“invisible things”</em> of Him and we know there is a God who spoke and created all these things. It is the only rational explanation. It is the only wise explanation. It is the only possible explanation for life.</p>  

<p>Let us be honest and true – it is impossible for everything to have come from a microscopic electron because that electron had to come from somewhere. Where did it come from? Ultimately, if they were forced to answer, they would have to say it was either <em>“eternal matter”</em> or it came from <em>“nothing.”</em> Some text books actually say that everything came from <em>“nothing.”</em> Is that science? Is that reasonable? It that a rational explanation? No, it is utter foolishness.</p>

<p>The second problem with what the world tries to tell us is that the things that are alive came from something that was not alive. It is like saying that life came from a rock. This is what the wisdom of mankind declares to people. They say that man came from a <em>“lifeless thing”</em> and then there was <em>“life.”</em> We will not even get into all the miraculous things that would have to have happened in order for all the life forms around us to have developed into the complex creatures that exist. It is unreasonable to hold to the theory of evolution and, yet, it is a very entrenched theory that is held as fact by the people of the world because, as the Bible says, <em>“professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.”</em> They must insist on some other explanation other than God and, therefore, they contort as they try to justify and rationalize and explanation for all the life that is around them. What explanation can there be other than the truth? The fact is this: <em>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”</em> This is an unacceptable truth to the natural-minded man that rejects God and anything that is not of the physical, natural realm and, therefore, man is left with only foolish options.</p>  

<p>The absurdity of the theory of evolution is really the result of rejecting the only factual answer and that leaves them only things they can accept in the natural realm. Yet, when people try to put forth this theory, it is just foolish. It is ridiculous. It is something that makes no sense.</p>

<p>Let us go back to Genesis 1:1, where it says, <em>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”</em> The Hebrew word translated as <em>“God”</em> is Strong’s #430 and it is the word <em>“elohiym”</em> and this word is a plural word. It is a plural name for God and it is used 32 times in Genesis, chapter 1 wherever you see the word <em>“God.”</em> It is always <em>“elohiym”</em> and this word is used over 60 times from Genesis, chapter 1 to Genesis, chapter 5.</p>  

<p>Interestingly, this plural Hebrew word for God is also found in Deuteronomy 6:4:</p>

<p class="verse">Hear, O Israel: JEHOVAH our God <em>is</em> JEHOVAH:</p> 

<p>Our <em>“God”</em> is one JEHOVAH and the Bible reveals the Person of God as one God, but three distinct Persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. We read in John 1:1-4:</p>

<p class="verse">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>

<p>In this passage we read that in the beginning was <em>“the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”</em> God is revealing His Person and what his being is like in the very first verse of the Bible when it says, <em>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”</em> We can know from the use of the word <em>“elohiym”</em> that the fullness of the Godhead already existed and the Word of God was also present at that point because the Word of God created all things, as we read of the Lord Jesus in Colossians 1:15-17:</p>

<p class="verse">Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether <em>they be</em> thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</p>

<p>Here is our answer to the origins of all things. Our answer is provided by God and it is the solution to the mystery. It is not a fanciful theory. Life did not come from a rock or life did not come from nothing. The elect child of God realizes that the truth of the matter is that in the beginning the Triune God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) created the world and all that we see around us – every human being, every creature and all life of any kind. It all came from God. The Word of God (the Lord Jesus Christ) spoke and brought this world into existence. He created all things that are seen from things that are not seen, as it says in Hebrews 11:3:</p>
<p class="verse">Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</p>

<p>Everything that is presently <em>“seen”</em> in this world and everything we can perceive with our senses were made of things that were <em>“not seen.”</em> There was nothing as far as this creation is concerned, but there was God and He existed and lived. He <em>“was”</em> in the beginning. The Bible tells us that this is an attribute of God – He <em>“lives.”</em> That is what God said to Moses at the burning bush when Moses inquired, <em>“When the Israelites ask me who sent me, what shall I tell them?”</em> God replied, <em>“I AM THAT I AM.”</em> That is the statement of <em>“existence”</em> and of <em>“being.”</em> The Bible goes on to further explain that Jesus is <em>“the same yesterday, to day, and for ever.”</em> This statement uses a time reference, but we have more statements from the Word of God. For instance, it says in Psalm 90:2:</p>

<p class="verse">Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou <em>art</em> God.</p>

<p>He is the <em>“GREAT I AM,”</em> the ever-existent One and the One that inhabits the entire spectrum of existence, as it says in Isaiah 57:15:</p>

<p class="verse">For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name <em>is</em> Holy…</p>

<p>This is our only possible explanation for life and the existence of all things. It is the origin of all things that are visible. They are the result of the creations of the One that is the invisible God. It is the <em>“elohiym,”</em> and it is the Word that was in the beginning and the One that inhabits eternity and has always been in existence in what we call “eternity past.” For as far back as we could travel into that eternal past, we would always find God. There is no beginning to God. God is from everlasting. This is a mystery to us, but somehow God has always been. He has not only always existed, but He is the essence of life. This all powerful Being has always inhabited eternity from “eternity past” to <em>“eternity future.”</em> He <em>“is”</em> God. God is the incredible, awesome and all mighty Being who created all things, as it says in Colossians, <em>“by him, and for him.”</em> The world was created for God and to serve God’s purposes. Creatures were created for God and to serve God’s purposes, so whatever He does with creation is for Himself and to serve His purposes. If the <em>“creature”</em> does not like that fact, it is insignificant. The fact is that all creation was <em>“created by him, and for him.”</em></p>
