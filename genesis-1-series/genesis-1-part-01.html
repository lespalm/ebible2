	<div class="body-content">  
<p>Welcome to EBible Fellowship’s Bible study in the Book of Genesis. This is study #1 of Genesis chapter 1 and I will read Genesis 1:1-5:</p>

<p class="verse">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness <em>was</em> upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that <em>it was</em> good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</p> 

<p>I will stop reading there. When we come to the Book of Genesis, it is the opening statement of the Bible and it actually describes (in a single verse) the origin of all things seen and unseen. God gives us the explanation regarding the existence of all things, as mankind has often wondered, <em>“Where did everything come from?”</em> Man looks into the sky and sees the stars shining at night and the sun shining in the day. He can walk around and see the flowers, the trees and the flowing stream. He can even see an anthill and see these curious creatures swarming around the anthill and so many other creatures. Everywhere we look in this world we see things that exist and we also have our own existence and God has given man a mind to think and reason and man has always wondered for thousands of years about where everything came from and God gives a full explanation in Genesis 1:1: <em>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”</em> This is the solution to the mystery of where the mountains, the seas and all the creatures came from and where man came from and how the entire universe came forth.</p> 

<p>The answer that God gives is in the Bible and the Bible provides an answer that is really the only answer and the only solution that can solve the mystery and answer the questions concerning origins: <em>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”</em></p>

<p>Yes, there are other questions, like <em>“Who is God and where did He come from?”</em> But, as far as the origin of this present creation and all things that exist, the answer is that God created them. Contrast this with modern scientific thought and with what is taught today in schools and universities all over the world. They say that the universe had a natural origin and there was no Being that created all things. The natural mind of man rejects God because they cannot see Him or touch Him or use their senses to detect Him and, therefore, God does not exist (for them). He is outside the natural sphere of things. He is outside the physical realm and they cannot detect Him or prove Him and according to modern scientific thought God does not exist. And since God does not exist, He is not a possible explanation for the existence of all things and, therefore, these <em>“brilliant minds”</em> begin to put their own minds to work to explain where everything came from and they have developed the theory of the <em>“Big Bang.”</em> Here is a quote from “Live Science” and I will read a paragraph:</p>
<blockquote class="big_bang">
	<p><em>According to the standard of the “Big Bang Model,” the universe was born during a period of inflation that began about 13.7 billion years ago like a rapidly expanding balloon. It swelled from a size smaller than an electron to nearly its current size within a tiny fraction of a second.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That describes the so-called <em>“Big Bang”</em> and it was the size of an electron and then something happened and it expanded like a balloon when you blow air into it and it got bigger and bigger until it was its current size. Some scientists have noticed through their telescopes that the universe is still expanding and stretching further outward, so they reason that it is still the effects of the “Big Bang” as the universe continues to expand.</p>

<p>Well, that is fine except they have used a little <em>“sleight of hand”</em> with this explanation. Often students sit in a classroom and listen to their professors and they give them a lot of credit, as they think that the scientists have the answers and they should certainly know about these things, especially when they say it happened 13.7 billion years ago. Adding the number <em>"7"</em> seems to add authenticity to their statement, as they specifically say <em>“13.7 billion years ago.”</em> This statement is delivered in a very confident and direct way and people think it is fact and, yet, these scientists do not have the <em>“foggiest idea”</em> of how things originated.</p>  

<p>For instance, in the statement I just read they take for granted that there existed a particle that was <em>“smaller than an electron”</em> and 13.7 billion years ago. So they are saying there was <em>“something”</em> that existed that was just a miniscule thing smaller than an electron. They have no idea what they are talking about, but they begin their theory with its existence – it had “pre-existed” and was there already. Then they put their theory into motion and they say this small thing expanded and exploded. But, hold it!  Hold it! They have not answered the question of origin. Now let us ask the question: <em>“Where did this thing that was smaller than an electron come from?"</em> One of the most brilliant scientists, Stephen Hawkins, has put forth his theory and, yet, he concludes his lecture by saying that we are <em>“getting close”</em> to understanding the mystery of origin. In other words, they have no answer. They have no solution. They have theories, but they are not even declaring that these are the final truths because there are so many faults in their theories and they cannot support their theories.</p>

<p>Of course, they cannot support their theories because they have no answer. An <em>“origin”</em> is a foundation and it is that upon which everything is built. For instance, if you are going to build a house, you need a foundation stone and then you construct your house upon that stone. The Bible gives a good illustration of this because the Bible likens Christ to the </em>“stone”</em> upon which the (spiritual) house of God is built. They are built upon a sure foundation and when the storm of Judgment Day comes all those that are built upon that Rock will stand and endure. They are part of a sound house that can withstand the storm.</p>

<p>When we look at the beginning of all things and the question of where everything originated, evolution is the same presupposition that scientists use for evolution and that is <em>“there is no God.”</em> Because they cannot prove there is a God and we cannot prove the existence of spirit beings, they conclude there is no God.</p>  

<p>Then where did all the creatures originate and where did the ants, the elephants and man originate?  But, first, where did the universe originate? It came from the <em>“Big Bang,”</em> they say and after that there was <em>“evolution”</em> and things began to develop into creatures. It does not matter that these creatures are complex and intricate and amazingly designed. When we look through a microscope or telescope at any part of God’s creation we see very definite design. Things just could not have fallen together randomly or accidently because it just does not happen that way anywhere else, but none of that matters because they are absolutely convinced there is no God and there must be some other explanation. It does not matter how far-fetched or ridiculous the other explanations are, it must be the explanation because they have no God. Yet, with their theory of the origin of all things, they have no <em>“beginning point”</em> and they have no explanation for how everything got here or, at least, no explanation they will admit to being true. The natural-minded individual accepts the things being taught in high schools and universities today and because these things are written in a text book, they think it must be true and, yet, they have no rational explanation for the beginning of all things.</p>

<p>There are only two options for the origin of all things or for the <em>“genesis”</em> of all things. The word <em>“genesis”</em> means <em>“beginning”</em> and there are only two options that are possible:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>God created these things, as it says in Genesis 1:1: <em>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”</em> God is the “mover” or the primary cause of all things. Every creature exists and functions and the world operates the way it does because of God. This is a very rational, reasonable and full explanation for everything we see. It explains the complex design found in creatures all around us. It explains mankind as the special creature that was created in God’s own image. Man is a moral creature that knows good and evil and right and wrong. The Bible’s explanation is full and complete and explains everything in the entire realm of created things. The people of God look at this explanation and are content. They fully believe it and they fully trust it and it is a good thing because it is the best explanation. It is the most rational explanation.</li>
		<li>The <em>“Big Bang”</em> created these things. There was something in the beginning that was smaller than an electron and it exploded and it has been ever-expanding to this day and, in addition, evolution developed the creatures. All the creatures began to <em>“miraculously”</em> develop, even though we do not have a world full of deformed creatures as one would expect with <em>“random chance”</em> and haphazard development. We do not find that. Instead, we find very well designed and amazing creatures in the animals of the land, sea and sky, with man the crowning creature. Incredible design is evident and it does not match with the “evolution theory” that followed the <em>“Big Bang”</em> theory. It is just absurd.</li>
	</ol>
	
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the <em>“Big Bang”</em> does not explain all things because we have to go back to that original <em>“matter”</em> that was the size of an electron and we must ask the question: <em>“Where did that small piece of matter originate?”</em> We cannot just push the question back. That is what scientists say they are working on and they say they are close to answering that question.</p>

<p>But, really, there is only one answer and they do not want to admit to it. The only answer they have is that this small piece of <em>“matter”</em> that was small as an electron always existed. It was <em>“eternal”</em> and it had always existed or it came from something else that had always existed, and so on. There must be some form of <em>“matter”</em> or <em>“substance”</em> that has always been and that has always existed and then it was finally <em>“acted upon”</em> or it <em>“exploded”</em> to become these things, but it must have been something that is eternal.</p>

<p>So the first option for the origin of all things is that eternal God who is a thinking and all-powerful being spoke and brought the world into creation. He is infinite in wisdom and can design the creatures and the earth and universe. The second option is a mindless, lifeless <em>“thing”</em> that was eternal and had no beginning and, suddenly, it exploded. Why did it explode? There is no explanation, but it exploded in the <em>“Big Bang.”</em> The scientists do not want to admit that they are <em>“stuck”</em> with eternal matter if there is no eternal God because the origin of all things require either an eternal being or eternal matter. You cannot get around that. The most brilliant scientists have spent endless hours theorizing about this and they have tried everything imaginable to come up with an explanation, but they cannot because they will not consider eternal God. They would rather not come out and say that matter is eternal because what is more believable – an eternal, brilliant Creator or a lifeless, mindless thing that has always existed and then somewhere along the line exploded to form this world and all its wonderful life forms?</p>  

<p>Not only is the Bible true, but in the first Book, in chapter 1, in the first verse, God says: <em>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”</em> God provided the solution to the mystery that has baffled philosophers and scientists and the most brilliant minds in the world for thousands of years and God sums it up very quickly and easily in this statement. He tells us in 1Corinthians 1:19-212:</p>
<p class="verse">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where <em>is</em> the wise? where <em>is</em> the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. </p>

<p>God has <em>“made foolish the wisdom of this world.”</em> That is all we can say, as we do not want to revile anyone or put down anyone. It is just a fact. The idea that the origin of all things is found in some unexplainable piece of miniscule matter that somehow exploded is just a foolish idea. The idea that this wonderful and beautiful and complex design we see all around us just evolved is foolish.</p>
