<p>Welcome to EBible Fellowship’s Sunday afternoon Bible study. Today is study #5 of Daniel, chapter 3, and we are going to read Daniel 3:12-18:</p>

<p class="verse">There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. Then Nebuchadnezzar in <em>his</em> rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king. Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, <em>Is it</em> true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; <em>well:</em> but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we <em>are</em> not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be <em>so</em>, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver <em>us</em> out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>

<p>I will stop reading there. We have been looking at this historical event over the last few studies and we saw that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego are types and figures of God’s elect. They give evidence of being God’s elect, also, but they represent all of God’s elect during the time of the Great Tribulation that took place at the beginning of the end of the world. The end of the world began on May 21, 1988 with the start of the Great Tribulation period. That was the time of Satan’s rising from the bottomless pit. It was the time he began to rule as the <em>“beast”</em> over the churches and congregations of the world and over the world, in general, in a far greater way than he had ever ruled before.</p>

<p>So, during this time in Babylon, King Nebuchadnezzar made the golden image and commanded that all were to bow down and worship the image. Nebuchadnezzar was a type of Satan who had rule over the corporate church and over all nations, but in this matter of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, his rule had limitation. He demanded worship and all were to bow down, including God’s elect. However, God’s elect cannot do that because God has given them a new heart and a new spirit and, therefore, they refuse to do it.</p>

<p>In this study, we will begin to look at the two options that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego had, as it related to the king’s command. The first option was that God would deliver them. The second option was that God would not deliver them. In either case, they would not bow down and worship the image.</p>

<p>In our last study, we read language in verse 15 that refers to an <em>“hour.”</em> It says at the end of Daniel 3:15:</p>

<p class="verse">… but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</p>

<p>We saw that the “hour” identifies with the Great Tribulation. For example, in the parable of the vineyard a householder hired laborers at three hour intervals – the third hour, sixth hour and ninth hour. But the pattern was broken when he hired some that were standing idle at the eleventh hour. It says in Matthew 20:6-12:</p>

<p class="verse">And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, <em>that</em> shall ye receive. So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them <em>their</em> hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that <em>were hired</em> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had received <em>it</em>, they murmured against the goodman of the house, Saying, These last have wrought <em>but</em> one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</p>

<p>The last group that was hired at the <em>“eleventh hour”</em> only worked <em>“one hour.”</em> This fits with other information where we read that Jesus said, <em>“Are there not twelve hours in the day?”</em> The work day was twelve hours in length, from 6:00AM to 6:00PM. These men were hired at 5:00PM and they worked until 6:00PM or only “one hour” and then the work day concluded. The work day, in this case, points to the <em>“day of salvation.”</em> There were other laborers that were hired earlier in the day and this would relate to the church age, which lasted 1,955 years and that represents most the <em>“day of salvation,”</em> but God had a plan at the very end to save the great multitude. He did that during the little season of the Great Tribulation, the last (about) 17 years of the 23-year Great Tribulation period. That 17 years represents the last “hour.” In verse 12, it said, <em>“These last have wrought but one hour.”</em> There were no workers coming in at a later hour because no one can work in the <em>“night.”</em> That was Christ’s point when He said in John 9:4:</p>

<p class="verse">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>

<p>There is the <em>“day of salvation”</em> and then comes Judgment Day, which is likened to <em>“night,”</em> spiritually. You cannot perform the work of salvation (the work of Christ) when it is night, the time when <em>“no man can work,”</em> and the man in view is Christ. So, the eleventh to the twelfth hour was the last hour of the work day to be performed in the vineyard and the vineyard is where the <em>“fruit”</em> grows. In James 5, verse 7 we learn that God is the husbandman that has long patience waiting for the precious fruit of the earth until He would receive the early and the latter rain. The Latter Rain was the last 17 years of the Great Tribulation and when that <em>“last hour”</em> concluded, the rain stopped falling because it had accomplished its final purpose in bringing forth fruit. There would be no more rain, no more fruit and no more work. The work day was finished.</p>

<p>For our purposes, Daniel, chapter 3 mentions that same <em>“hour”</em> and it is also a reference to the <em>“hour”</em> of Great Tribulation. Concerning that hour, we read something very interesting in Mark 13:8-13:</p>

<p class="verse">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these <em>are</em> the beginnings of sorrows. But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. And the gospel must first be published among all nations. But when they shall lead <em>you</em>, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against <em>their</em> parents, and shall cause them to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all <em>men</em> for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p>

<p>God is speaking of that <em>“hour”</em> and when He isolates an hour in this manner, it points to the Great Tribulation. He is saying that when we come to this <em>“hour,”</em> we are not to take thought beforehand what we will say. This is an amazing statement concerning the Bible because God normally encourages His people to study and to meditate on the Bible, so we can give an answer; we are told to investigate and check things out to make sure of what we say about things in the Bible. That is why this statement stands out so much: <em>“take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate.”</em> We wonder why God would tell His people not to think beforehand and not to premeditate or ponder the Scriptures and be prepared in the things we would say. God wants His people to speak knowledgably and to declare the Word of God based on study. But there is one exception to that. There was all the study and all the premeditation that went on during the church age as theologians, pastors and God’s elect went to the Bible and studied the Bible, but the Bible tells us that things they were studying regarding the end time were sealed and closed to their understanding. There was no ability to break that seal on the Scriptures and to open the Book (the Bible) that had been sealed because God sealed it until the time of the end. No matter how diligent, studious and faithful a student of the Bible was throughout the centuries of the church age, they could not understand chapters like Matthew 24, Mark 13 or the Book of Revelation. No matter how much they studied or how much they prayed to God for wisdom, it did not matter, because God had determined to seal that information. They could have some partial understanding as they <em>“saw through a glass darkly,”</em> but the right and proper understanding would not come until the time of the end. So, in these verses in Mark 13 God says in Mark 13:11:</p>

<p class="verse">… take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Here, we see the reference to a plain statement that is a commentary on Daniel 12:4:</p>

<p class="verse">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, <em>even</em> to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</p>

<p>Although it is not stated directly, the implication is clear that the Bible is sealed to the time of the end and then the seal is taken off. When the seals are taken off, knowledge increases and greater understanding is given to the people of God. That is what is being said in Mark 13:11:</p>

<p class="verse">… but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>We have talked about this before, but the obvious question is: How is it possible that God’s elect would be given knowledge and understanding during that last hour (the Great Tribulation) and it would not be us that spoke but the Holy Ghost? The normal reaction from the child of God when we learn things from the Bible is that we do not keep it to ourselves: <em>“Oh, what a wonderful thing I just learned in the Bible and it is all for me and nobody else.”</em> That is not the nature of a child of God. God would give some understanding of a Scripture to one person, but He wanted all His people to have this knowledge and to hear this new information that came forth from the Bible. God would cause that individual to tell others and that is one of the reasons that some people come up with their idea from the own minds that there are not to be teachers any more, but whenever someone thinks he has learned something from the Bible and he shares it with others, he is teaching. He does not have to officially say, <em>“Now I am teaching.”</em> It is what happens whenever we share something from the Bible. The sharing of Biblical knowledge is not to be hindered or held back – that would be very selfish. The idea that everyone is just to have their own truth, knowledge and understanding and not care about what anyone else knows or understands from the Bible is not biblical.</p>

<p>In this case in Mark 13, God is saying of whatever is given us during the hour of the Great Tribulation: <em>“…but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.”</em> Again, we wonder how we can speak and, yet, it is not we that speak but the Holy Spirit. It gets more difficult once we realize that God has completed the Bible and He will not break the barrier of the supernatural in bringing divine revelation. He has constrained Himself not to speak audibly after the Bible was completed by the end of the 1st century AD. So, we can see the problem for theologians or anyone reading the Bible throughout history when we realize that God is speaking of the end of time during the Great Tribulation and He says that He will give information that His people are to speak and, yet, they are not the ones speaking, but it is the Holy Ghost that is speaking. The only answer comes through comparison of Scriptures, as the Bible tells us in 1Corinthians 2:12:</p>

<p class="verse">Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</p>

<p>Here, again, we see God giving information. Then it tells us in the next verse how God gives us truth, in 1Corinthians 2:13:</p>

<p class="verse">Which things also we speak…</p>

<p>This matches Mark 13, which said, <em>“…but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye.”</em> Again, it says in 1Corinthians 2:13:</p>

<p class="verse">Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>

<p>The teaching of this verse is that when we follow the Biblical guideline and the Bible’s methodology of coming to truth, it must be by comparing Scripture with Scripture and harmonizing our conclusion with the entire Bible, then it is not we that have come up with that truth, but God the Holy Spirit. All we do is to speak it or proclaim it and when we do so, the <em>“Holy Ghost speaketh.”</em> Again, it said in Mark 13:11:</p>

<p class="verse">… but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye…</p>

<p>In other words, God’s people will follow the proper methodology of comparing Scripture with Scripture. We will search the Bible everywhere and we will check out each word and we will go wherever the words lead us and, as we do so, the Holy Ghost will reveal truth to us and we will <em>“speak.”</em> Once we declare it, for all intents and purposes, it is not we that speak, but the Holy Ghost because it is the truth from the Bible. It is the Holy Ghost that is teaching these things, if the proper methodology has been followed. God’s Holy Spirit teaches <em>“in that hour,”</em> the last hour of Great Tribulation.</p>

<p>Notice the (end time) context of Mark, chapter 13, where it says in Mark 13:12-13:</p>

<p class="verse">Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against <em>their</em> parents, and shall cause them to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all <em>men</em> for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p>

<p>In our last study, we were looking at Matthew, chapter 10, which has much of the same information as Matthew, chapter 24, which identifies with the Great Tribulation. For instance, it says in Matthew 10:17-18:</p>

<p class="verse">But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</p>

<p>When we compare it to Mark, chapter 13, it says in Mark 13:9:</p>

<p class="verse">But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.</p>
<p>In some cases, the language is identical. Then it says in Matthew 10:19-20:</p>

<p class="verse">But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</p>

<p>Again, we can see that God takes full responsibility for the information that comes forth from the Bible during that last <em>“hour,”</em> the Great Tribulation.</p>

<p>We know the information that came forth because we have already gone through that <em>“last hour,”</em> which was May 21, 1988 through May 21, 2011, exactly 23 years of Great Tribulation. During that time God brought forth information regarding His true salvation program, such as the fact that we are saved by the faith of Christ. God brought forth information that Christ had made payment for sin at the foundation of the world and not at the cross in 33AD. He brought forth information regarding the true payment for sin, which is annihilation and not the doctrine of spending an eternity of suffering in a place of torment called Hell. God brought forth true information about the end of the church age and His command to His people to <em>“come out of her”</em> was a mechanism He used to separate the wheat from the tares. God brought forth the true information regarding the end of the Great Tribulation and the beginning of Judgment Day on May 21, 2011. This is just some of the information that did come forth.</p>

<p>Here in Matthew 10, verse 20 and in Mark 13, verse 11 God gives us the information that it is not we that speak; that is, if the proper methodology of comparing Scripture with Scripture is used, then it is not the individual believer that speaks these things, but it is the Spirit of the Father that speaketh in you. As Mr. Camping and others proclaimed these truths regarding the end time, many people reviled and ridiculed us and spoke evil of us. Remember, in the Bible the word <em>“blaspheme”</em> means to speak evil of something or someone. When they spoke evil of these things they were blaspheming that which had come forth from the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit. It was the Holy Spirit that spoke in that <em>“hour.”</em></p>

<p>So, we are going to consider that more in a minute. We will consider if the sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit was committed during the time of the Great Tribulation. People might respond, <em>“Well, we were just speaking against a man and his teaching. He was over-spiritualizing the Bible.”</em> If you believe that, you need to listen to these studies closely---and I have done that, again, and again. I have listened to Mr. Camping’s studies many times since May 21, 2011 and over 99% of the time they are true to Scriptures. You will find that Scripture was carefully compared with Scripture, and the entire Bible was considered in the conclusions drawn. For God’s people that proclaimed these truths during the Great Tribulation, they might start out in Matthew 24 and then go to Mark 13 and they would <em>“follow a word”</em> through the Bible, exactly as 1Corinthians 2:13: <em>“Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.”</em> For someone to be justified in their condemnation and criticism of these teachings, they would have to find in the teaching itself that error was made by not comparing Scripture with Scripture; or, that error was made because the teaching was based on a dream or vision or tongues; or, error was made based on the idea of a theologian or a creed or confession outside of Scripture. It would have to be based on something outside of the God-ordained methodology of comparing Scripture with Scripture in reaching the conclusion. But no one ever does that. No one ever says that. No one has found that error to be the case.</p>

<p>Again, I will use Mr. Camping as an example because he was the main teacher God utilized as he spoke what the Bible was teaching. Family Radio reached virtually the entire world during that <em>“last hour”</em> of the Great Tribulation. Of course, that could only have been accomplished by the Lord granting a platform capable of broadcasting the Gospel to all the world in that way. When you listened to Mr. Camping’s teachings, you would have found it in keeping with the constraints the Bible placed on those that would teach through the Bible’s own guidelines of comparing Scripture with Scripture.</p>

<p>You cannot just look at the conclusion. You cannot say, <em>“I looked at the conclusion. Since May 21, 2011 did not happen in a physical way, Mr. Camping was a false prophet and what he taught was heresy.”</em> That is not correct. How can someone be a false prophet or heretic if they were following the Bible’s own hermeneutic in arriving at truth? I do not think there is a person that has ever lived (that I know of) who followed the Biblical hermeneutic of carefully comparing Scripture with Scripture more than Mr. Camping did. He taught others that this was the way to study the Bible because the Bible declared that this was the proper way to study the Bible. So, anyone that would pull up a study prior to May 21, 2011 or anyone that would lay out one of his teaching books, they cannot show that he went astray and did not follow the correct hermeneutic of comparing Scripture with Scripture.</p>

<p>You do not find that, but what you do find is that people say, <em>“Nothing happened (on May 21, 2011) and, therefore….”</em> In fact, they condemn even the methodology when they do not go to the Bible to see if the correct methodology was used. If they would do that, they would find that Mr. Camping did use the correct methodology. So, if the correct methodology was used and it took place during that time in that <em>“hour”</em> when God said He would open much truth, how then did Mr. Camping reach a wrong conclusion that May 21, 2011 was Judgment Day? Further study using the same methodology of comparing Scripture with Scripture shows that it was not a wrong conclusion. It was the correct conclusion. It was, indeed, Judgment Day. Of course, we could talk about that for a while, but first I want to get into what is being implied here and that is that God says that the Holy Spirit will <em>“speak”</em> in a special way. God does not tell us to speak what was given us for the first eleven hours (throughout the church age) and the Holy Ghost would speak. Of course, whenever anything from the Bible is taught correctly it is the Holy Ghost that speaks, but God emphasizes and sets apart that <em>“last hour”</em> of the Great Tribulation when the Holy Spirit will speak especially, because it is at that time He removed the seal from the Book and opened the Scriptures. Much information that was sealed until the time of the end came forth and as the information came forth regarding the doctrines I mentioned earlier, there was so much information it was likened to a <em>“new covenant”</em> in Hebrews, chapter 8. We have the Old Testament and God gave that divine revelation, but it was limited. They were historical parables and many things were unclear. Then God brought forth the New Testament divine revelation that He gave to men like Peter, John and the Apostle Paul. Then the Lord completed the Bible and the New Testament interpreted many things in the Old Testament and we could see the types and figures of the sacrifices, and so forth, but many things were still unclear.</p>

<p>That was all in God’s plan because He had a plan to reveal more truths regarding His salvation and judgment programs. He did not reveal it all at once to the Old Testament saints or even to the New Testament church age saints. In the New Testament church age, we had the whole Bible, but we were still limited in our spiritual understanding. God reserved much information for the proper time. The Lord would not break the barrier of the supernatural and He would not add a word to the Bible’s sixty-six books. There would not be additional revelation in that sense. There would be no dream or vision or tongue given that could be added to the Bible, but what God would do to <em>“complete”</em> the revelation was to utilize the methodology He allowed, which was comparing Scripture with Scripture. When the people of God would do so in the proper season of the Great Tribulation, then the Lord opened the Scriptures and His people began to see such tremendous truths that it was as though it was a <em>“new covenant.”</em> There was so much revelation and when the people of God were given these things, they were to <em>“speak”</em> them and proclaim them to the world. We taught the end of the church age and the approaching Day of Judgment and the whole world heard it.</p>

<p>In that context, God says in Matthew 10:22:</p>

<p class="verse">And ye shall be hated of all <em>men</em> for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</p>

<p>There is no question that this is speaking of the Great Tribulation. It matches Matthew 24 and Mark 13. Then it says in Matthew 10:24-25:</p>

<p class="verse">The disciple is not above <em>his</em> master, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more <em>shall they call</em> them of his household?</p>

<p>Hold it a second. God is speaking of bringing forth information and the Holy Spirit will <em>“speak”</em> and God is indicating here that there will be hostility toward it. Then He reminds us that we are only disciples and servants and He directs our attention to the Lord: <em>“If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?”</em> Notice it goes on to say in Matthew 10:26:</p>

<p class="verse">Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</p>

<p>This would fit in with the opening of the Scriptures. These things are now revealed and they are now known. Then it says in Matthew 10:27:</p>

<p class="verse">What I tell you in darkness, <em>that</em> speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, <em>that</em> preach ye upon the housetops.</p>

<p>Again, we have the same formula: God reveals truth and His people speak it. But when we speak it, it is the Holy Spirit that teacheth. God reminds us that they <em>“have called the master of the house Beelzebub.”</em> It says in Mark 3:22-30:</p>

<p class="verse">And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils. And he called them <em>unto him</em>, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation: Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</p>

<p>This is the sin of blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. It was committed by who? Was it committed by the scribes and chief priests that said he had Beelzebub? No. They did do these things, but God tells us the reason for the sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit: <em>“Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.”</em> We can understand that to be true not of these certain individuals, but true of the corporate institution or corporate body of national Israel. The corporate body was led by Pharisees, scribes and chief priests, and so forth, but they were representative of the synagogue system of Israel that God identified as His people, corporately, for many centuries. But now it was coming to the point when they were going to kill the Lord Jesus Christ and when Christ hung on the cross the veil of the temple was rent in twain and God would be finished with national Israel. When God was finished with Israel, would there ever be forgiveness or salvation within their system of worship ever again? The answer is, <em>“No.”</em> The sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit is a corporate sin that comes into view at certain important points in history when God is about to make a change in His program. God was about to make a change in His program when He introduced the Lord Jesus Christ into the world and Christ was testifying of all sorts of new information to them and they were receiving an abundance of revelation through Him and later through His disciples, but they rejected it. They refused it. They turned away from this information and they labeled it as coming from Beelzebub, which was saying that the information was from Satan and not from God. That was the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit which was committed by corporate Israel and, as a result, there was condemnation from God and they were <em>“cut off.”</em> Never again would there be forgiveness of sins in the synagogue system of Israel.</p>

<p>We can prove this. If someone went to the synagogue during the day of salvation and they heard the Old Testament, which is part of the Bible, could that person become saved? No. That person could have received a Christian tract from a source outside the synagogue and that person could have read it and be drawn out of the synagogue system and become saved, but they could not be saved through the preaching of the Rabbi because the Lord Jesus cursed the fig tree, which is synonymous with the sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit – there was not to be forgiveness of sin forever in them: <em>“Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.”</em> That was the judgment of God because they blasphemed the Holy Spirit. God could have said they blasphemed Jesus because they were saying this of Him, but instead God identifies it as the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth. It was the Spirit that was bringing forth this information through Jesus and would continue to bring forth information through the disciples and apostles until the New Testament was completed. They blasphemed the divine revelation the Spirit was bringing forth and they said it was of Satan and, therefore, they were cut off.</p>

<p>I do not think we will have enough time to get into this subject in this study, but it says in 1Timothy 1:12-13:</p>
<p class="verse">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did <em>it</em> ignorantly in unbelief.</p>

<p>The Apostle Paul did something along the same lines as those scribes and Pharisees did to Jesus because he thought the Christian movement was heresy and if you think something is heresy, you think Satan is behind it.</p>

<p>Paul confessed that he had been a blasphemer and, yet, he found mercy and that shows us that an individual might think evil of Christ or think something is of Satan, but that does not prevent an individual from possibly receiving forgiveness of sins. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is only a corporate sin. It is like what we read in Jeremiah, where it says, <em>“Pray not for this people,”</em> and some people thought we were not to pray for people that remained in the corporate church, but it did not mean that; it meant that we were not to pray for the work of the corporate body of the churches. In our next study, we may look at these kinds of verses because it all fits into blasphemy of the Holy Spirit as it relates to the corporate body.</p>

<p>It says in 1Timothy 1:19:</p>

<p class="verse">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</p>

<p>The shipwreck in Acts 27 was a dramatic illustration of the end of the church age, as the ship typified the corporate church. Here it speaks of faith being made shipwreck.</p>

<p>Then it goes on to say in 1Timothy 1:20:</p>

<p class="verse">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>

<p>This is what God did to the corporate New Testament churches. When he loosed Satan, He turned the churches over to him and delivered them up to him. Why did God do that? Hymenaeus and Alexander are a type of the corporate body and they were delivered over to Satan and the reason was given at the end of verse 20: <em>“that they may learn not to blaspheme.”</em> The corporate church was given over into the hand of Satan for its destruction that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>

<p>Revelation, chapter 13 describes the <em>“beast”</em> (Satan) coming up out of the sea and ascending to rule in the churches during the Great Tribulation. It says in Revelation 13:6:</p>
<p class="verse">And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have run out of time. Lord willing, we will pick this up in our next Bible study and see what God says about the sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit in that <em>“hour”</em> of the Great Tribulation.</p>
