<div class="body-content">
<p>Welcome to EBible Fellowship’s Sunday afternoon Bible study. Today we are going to continue to take a look at two Jubilees that we began to look at in our last Bible study. We are slowly looking at more information related to similarities between the first coming of Christ and the second coming of Christ as centered around Jubilee Years. The year Christ was born was 7BC and it was a Jubilee Year and the year 1994 was also a Jubilee Year, two thousand years from the time Jesus was born.</p>

<p>We are seeing several similarities between the significance of those years and the possible same alignment of years for the second coming of Christ. Again, it relates to the Jubilee and concerning Jubilee Years, it says in Leviticus 25:8-11:</p>

And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth <em>day</em> of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout <em>all</em> the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.</p> 

<p>I will stop reading there. Here, God is laying out the Law for the Jubilee Year and how it was to be observed, historically, every 50 years beginning in 1407BC and all through history. On the Old Testament side the Jubilee Year fell in years ending with <em>“07”</em> or <em>“57,”</em> so 7BC was a Jubilee Year and it was the time the Bible’s evidence points to as the year Jesus was born. Very possibly, he was born on the Day of Atonement in that Jubilee Year and that would be the day, according to Leviticus 25, that they would proclaim liberty and cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the Day of Atonement and that trumpet sound was to be the proclamation of liberty.  And that is exactly what Jesus came to do, as He set the captives free and took captivity captive.  As Jesus said in the Gospel of John in John 8:36:</p>

<p class="verse">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</p>

<p>Also, it says in Galatians 5:1:</p>

<p class="verse">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</p>

<p>Everything related to the Gospel and salvation has to do with <em>“liberty”</em> because sinners are enslaved to sin and to Satan. They are bound about with the cords of their own iniquity. They are in chains in spiritual bondage. Salvation is the releasing of the sinner from this bondage. Remember when Jesus sent two of His disciples to loose the ass so He could use it.  It says in Mark 11:1-7:</p>

<p class="verse">And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring <em>him</em>. And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him. And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.</p>

<p>In the Bible, <em>“to sit”</em> means <em>“to rule.”</em>  The colt was bound and it is a picture of sinners that Christ came to set at liberty and to free them from their bondage, so Christ sent the disciples and the disciples loosed the colt.  It is just like Christ sends the Gospel in the hands of His people to others that are bound in sin and through that process sinners heard the Word and they were set free. Then the colt was brought to the Lord Jesus. The colt is no longer bound and now Christ <em>“sits”</em> upon him and it was a colt no man had ever sat upon because Christ had not ruled over him previously, but now He is Lord over the one He has saved. This is the idea behind the Jubilee – it was a time to set the captives free. When Jesus was born into the world in a Jubilee Year on the Day of Atonement (most likely), He was the essence of the Jubilee because He would be the one to deliver His people. It was all part of the process.</p>  

<p>So, in that year of 7BC God fulfilled the spiritual meaning of the Jubilee. We would think that since Jesus came in a Jubilee Year on the Day of Atonement and fulfilled the Jubilee that there would be no need to fulfill it a second time. And, yet, God gave an indicator in the Book of Joshua that there would be more than one Jubilee.</p>

<p>The Hebrew word translated as <em>“jubile”</em> is Strong’s #3104 and it is translated that way in Leviticus, which we just read, but it is translated differently in Joshua, chapter 6. This chapter tells us about the Battle of Jericho, a very unusual battle in which God commanded the Israelites to march around the city one time a day for six days and then on the seventh day God commanded them to march around the city seven times, for a total of 13 times. We all know the story. On the 13th time around the city they were to blow with the trumpet and shout and the wall came tumbling down and it left Jericho defenseless.  If there was no wall to protect them, they were <em>“sitting ducks,”</em> as the expression goes, and the enemy army could destroy them. This is exactly what happened to Jericho. They had a great wall to protect them, but a wall is no defense against God, as God is able to overcome any obstacle man puts before Him.</p>

<p>Here, in Joshua, chapter 6 the word <em>“jubile”</em> is found several times, but it is translated as <em>“ram’s horns,”</em> plural. It is also translated as <em>“ram’s horns,”</em> singular, but it is still the word translated as <em>“jubile.”</em>  Let us read Joshua 6:3-4:</p>

<p class="verse">And ye shall compass the city, all <em>ye</em> men of war, <em>and</em> go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns…</p>

<p>The word translated as <em>“ram’s horns”</em> is the word <em>“jubiles,”</em> plural. Then it says in Joshua 6:4-5:</p>

… and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long <em>blast</em> with the ram's horn, <em>and</em> when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.</p> 

<p>Let me just make a comment here. This sounds similar to what we read in 1Thessalonians, chapter 4 because Jericho is a picture of the world and God is saying that when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout and then the wall of the city would fall down.  It is a picture of the end of the world. It says concerning the coming of Christ at the last day, in 1Thessalonians 4:14-18:</p>

<p class="verse">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>

<p>What is interesting is that we know that 1994 was a Jubilee Year and we know that Christ did not return then. Actually, there was evidence pointing to 1994 and with good reason because of the Bible’s language concerning the fulfillment of the Jubilee, but Christ did not return in 1994. Yet, we are now learning that the effect of the Jubilee Year (as demonstrated by Christ coming the first time in a Jubilee year) can carry decades into the future. For example, Jesus was born in 7BC as the essence of the Jubilee, but God waited and waited until the period of Christ’s ministry and the completion of the three and one half years of His ministry and then He went to the cross. Then fifty days later on the Day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out and it was really a result of the Jubilee and Jesus’ entry into the world. It was all a part of the fulfillment of the Jubilee. The first outpouring of the Holy Spirit that occurred on the Day of Pentecost in 33AD was very much tied to the birth of Christ in 7BC, some 40 calendar years or 39 actual years earlier.</p>

<p>Likewise, we are now considering that the Jubilee Year of 1994 that ushered in the second outpouring of the Holy Spirit stretched out over a prescribed period of time. We had thought it would stretch only to May 21, 2011 because that was the time God was saving people in the second part of the Great Tribulation wherein God saved the great multitude and completed His salvation plan.  We thought, <em>“Well, that completes the Jubilee.”</em> And, yet, if it followed the pattern of the first Jubilee, it would stretch out longer. In the last study I referred to it as an <em>“overarching”</em> timeline that would stretch beyond 2011 and if it followed the pattern of the first Jubilee, it would extend to 2033AD. At this point, let me just stress that we are not saying that this is for certain the end. We are just making observations and seeing the similarities between the first coming of Christ and the timeline that exists in our day when we know we have to be very close to the second coming or the end of the world. There is the possibility that 2033AD would follow the pattern of the first coming of Christ and it is interesting that the Bible does make a few comments in regard to this, such as what it says when Jesus was taken back to heaven 40 days after his resurrection. It says in Acts 1:11:</p>

<p>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</p>

<p>We tend to think they are just referring to that instant in which Jesus went up in the clouds, but what if it is not just referring to that particular instant?  What if it is a reference to His entire going or the whole timeline?  It is something for us to consider. God could be telling us to take a closer look at the first coming of Christ in order to understand the timeline for the second coming of Christ. We do see that from 7BC to 33AD the Jubilee had its fulfillment in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but even then the effects stretched 1,955 years from that point to encompass the entire church age. Then on May 21, 1988 God ended the church age and ended the first Jubilee. There would be no more firstfruits and no more early rain – the work of the Holy Spirit that had begun in 33AD concluded in 1988, ending the Jubilee. Then there was a period of 2,300 evening mornings after the Jubilee had ended when there was no rain. There was a spiritual famine.</p> 

<p>But then came September 1994 and God poured out His Holy Spirit a second time and He began to evangelize the earth outside of the churches and congregations to save the great multitude that no man could number.  He finished one part of that work on May 21, 2011 because He had saved all His elect and, yet, the completion of the second Jubilee was not accomplished because the essence of the Jubilee is Christ and it is deliverance from sin in all its aspects.  Yes, salvation of the soul is one part of that deliverance, but salvation from the physical body is another part. As we read in 1Thessalonians, chapter 4 that means that when Christ comes with the trumpet and a great shout, He is coming to resurrect the bodies of the saints whose spirits are already with Him in heaven and He is coming to rapture the living saints that are still alive on the earth. That will be the completion of the Jubilee, as the Jubilee will have accomplished complete deliverance as all the saints will receive new resurrected bodies that match their resurrected souls. We can see that with the shout and the trumpet of Christ’s coming. He could come 40 years (inclusive) or 39 actual years in completion of the 1994 Jubilee and that Jubilee would stretch out just as the first Jubilee stretched to 1,955 years. But the 1994 Jubilee stretches into eternity because it is an eternal deliverance from sin – it is eternal life.</p>  

<p>The historical parable we are reading about in Joshua, chapter 6 can relate to our timeline and the Jubilee Year of 1994. There is a <em>“shout”</em> and there is a “trumpet” blast at the time of the end of the world to signify Christ’s coming and even though it is not the year 1994 it was connected. Spiritually, it could very well be considered by God to be part of the second Jubilee. Again, it says in Joshua 6:5:</p>

<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long <em>blast</em> with the ram's horn…</p>

<p>Again, that word <em>“ram’s horns”</em> is <em>“jubilee.”</em> It also reminds us of what God said to Moses in Exodus 19:10-13:</p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, <em>that ye</em> go <em>not</em> up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether <em>it be</em> beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</p> 

<p>The word <em>“trumpet”</em> is Strong’s #3104, the word translated as <em>“jubile.”</em> It says, <em>“when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.”</em> On the third day when the Jubilee sounds long, they shall come up to the mount. Here, God is speaking of a prolonged trumpet blast of the Jubilee and we talked about that when we discussed the spiritual judgment that came on May 21, 2011 – it was a prolonged Judgment Day. There is some language that indicated that as soon as God brings judgment it is the last trumpet.  In order to understand how that could be if we are years into the Judgment Day period, we recognized that it could be a prolonged trumpet blast. But, now, we thinking about the Jubilee being a trumpet blast – you sound the trumpet on the day of Jubilee, but in Exodus, chapter 19 God is speaking of the Jubilee <em>“sounding long,”</em> and if we are understanding it correctly, the first Jubilee began in 7BC and extended 40 calendar years to 33AD, but beyond that for 1,955 more years. In 1994 in our time the trumpet blew and is <em>“sounding long,”</em> and it may extend 40 calendar years or 39 actual years to 2033AD. Do you see how that would fit the language of the Bible?  It is like God is indicating in Joshua that there is more than one jubilee period because he uses the plural for <em>“ram’s horns”</em> and it is associated with going around Jericho 13 times and the ram’s horn or Jubilee would sound. Again, it said in Joshua 6:5-8:</p>

<p class="verse">…and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him. And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of JEHOVAH. And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of JEHOVAH. And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before JEHOVAH, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of JEHOVAH followed them.</p>

<p>In verses 6 and 8 the word translated as <em>“ram’s horns”</em> is the word <em>“jubiles.”</em>  Again, we are seeing that God has all this information which relates to the <em>“shout”</em> and the <em>“trumpet”</em> that ties in with Christ coming at the end of time and the destruction of the world, as pictured by the walls of Jericho falling down.</p>

<p>Let us turn back again to the Book of Jonah.  It says in Jonah 3:1:</p>

<p class="verse">And the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</p>

<p>As we pointed out in the last study, the name <em>“Jonah”</em> means <em>“dove.”</em>  It is the identical word translated as <em>“dove”</em> in the Old Testament and God uses a <em>“dove”</em> in each of the four Gospel accounts to typify the Holy Spirit. The spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus like a dove, so when God came to Jonah, the dove, it is a picture of the Holy Spirit and it was the “second time.”</p> 

<p>By the way, the first time God came to Jonah, Jonah fled and got on a ship to flee to Tarshish. God sent a raging storm and Jonah was cast overboard and that relates to Christ going to the cross which was all part of the first outpouring of the Holy Spirit – it was all connected to His entry into the world and, eventually, going to the cross to demonstrate what He had done from the foundation of the world. The first time God directed Jonah to go to Nineveh in chapter 1 it ended up with him being cast into the sea and being in the whale’s belly was three days and three nights as a big part of the spiritual fulfillment of the first Jubilee, the first time the dove or Holy Spirit was poured out. It was all connected to that 40-year timeline from the birth of Christ until He went to the cross.</p>

<p>But, now, it is the second time God spoke to the <em>“dove,”</em> Jonah. He has come out of the whale’s belly and been <em>“resurrected.”</em> This is the Bible and God cannot cover two millenniums in just a few paragraphs, but we understand that based on the language where God says He came unto Jonah the <em>“second time,”</em> we know that God said He would stretch forth His hand a second time to recover the remnant of His people (Isaiah 11) and it relates to the second outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Then it says in Jonah 3:2-4:</p>

<p class="verse">Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of JEHOVAH. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</p>

<p>Then he stopped preaching, from everything we can tell and he went outside the city, according to Jonah, chapter 4.  He sat in a booth and God tells us the reason he did so, in Jonah 4:5: <em>“till he might see what would become of the city.”</em> That means that he waited in a booth or tabernacle outside the city of Nineveh for the next 39 days until the entire 40-day period had elapsed. Here, we see an interesting break between the 40 days. There was one day that Jonah preached and 39 days were of a different character wherein he was waiting to see what would happen to the city. That reminds us of the 39 actual years and the 40 inclusive years we see between 7BC and 33AD and between 1994 and 2033AD. The idea of <em>“39, but 40”</em> is found several places in the Bible. I will give one example before coming back here to Jonah.  It says in 2Corinthians 11:24:</p>

<p class="verse">Of the Jews five times received I forty <em>stripes</em> save one.</p>

<p>The 40 stripes was the maximum that the Law of God permitted and not to exceed, so the Jews sentenced him to the maximum penalty of 40 stripes, but he was given the stripes five times, but actually only 39 stripes (minus 1) because they feared to go over the maximum penalty established of God, so instead of 40 stripes they gave him 39 stripes. They did this five times, which is interesting.  So, we see 40 stripes, but actually 39 and this matches with the idea of the number of years being 40 calendar (inclusive) years, but actually 39 years. So, if we multiply <em>“39 x 5”</em> it comes up to 195 and the number 195 breaks down to 5 x 3 x 13.  The number <em>“5”</em> is the number for atonement and, again, the Day of Atonement ushered in the Jubilee, so from 7BC to 33AD is 39 actual years, but 40 inclusive years and from 1994 until 2033 is 39 actual years, but 40 inclusive years. With the stripes Paul is talking about, there is also the number <em>“3,”</em> which indicates God’s purpose and the number <em>“13”</em> relates to the end of the world, like the 13 times around Jericho. And Jericho relates to the Jubilee and the Jubilee relates to the Day of Atonement. So these bits of information are all connected in various ways.</p>

<p>Okay, let us go back to the Book of Jonah and we see that Jonah was commanded a second time to go forth the second time. When did God pour out the Holy Spirit a second time? It was the Jubilee Year in 1994. The first outpouring of the Holy Spirit had expired.  It ended in 1988. Then there was 2,300 evening mornings, a grievous time, in which the Holy Spirit was not officially sent any longer.  There was 2,300 days in which virtually no one became saved, but then the two witnesses stood on their feet, which meant that the Word of God (the law and the prophets) stood upon its feet and God would evangelize the earth a second time for the elect’s sake. He had many to save, so the Holy Spirit was poured out again and it went forth as a <em>“dove”</em> into the world. So, this account of Jonah (the <em>“dove”</em>) being sent ties in with the Jubilee Year and the Day of Atonement, the tenth day of the Hebrew seventh month, in which the trumpet would blow to signify it was a Jubilee Year of 1994. The picture in this historical parable relates to what we can identify in the Biblical calendar of history as the year 1994.</p>  

<p>Previously, Mr. Camping and Family Radio had taught this. It is nothing new to us, as Mr. Camping had pointed it out, but what we did not understand at that time was a 40-year timeline. We did not think that from 1994 there would be a 40-year timeline because we were looking at May 21, 2011 and then October 21, 2011. Then we started looking at October 7, 2015 and we were only looking within this overarching or overreaching timeline and we were concentrating on stages within the whole. This has been our tendency since September 1994. We thought that was it. Then we looked to May 21, 2011, and so forth. We have been looking at the stages within an overall timeline, but not seeing the framework or the overarching time period that extends beyond the various stages.</p>

<p>So, here in Jonah, chapter 3 God gave a timeline, does He not? He said, <em>“Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.”</em>  Now let us go to Numbers 14:33-34:</p>

<p class="verse">And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, <em>even</em> forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, <em>even</em> forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.</p> 

<p>We see a couple of things that are interesting here. God said they were to search the land 40 days and due to their murmuring God punished them and said, <em>“Each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities.”</em> So they would wander in the wilderness, a desolate land, for 40 years or a year for each day they searched the land. When God says <em>“40 days,”</em> we have to keep in mind that this is the Bible and it very well could be that God is saying, <em>“And yet forty years,”</em> so, is God saying, <em>“And yet forty years and Nineveh shall be overthrown”</em>?  Historically, we know that God did not destroy Nineveh, but that was a picture because God saved the people of Nineveh, which was a picture of His elect. God did eventually destroy Nineveh because it was the capital of Assyria and God did destroy the Assyrians, so when Jonah is declaring, <em>“Yet forty days,”</em> and the Holy Spirit is bringing a message that identifies with the year 1994 when the Holy Spirit was poured out a second time, is He saying, <em>“Yet forty years”</em>?  If we understand that each day represents a year, then the year 1994 (which the Book of Jonah is linked to) can be counted out over 40 years and you come to 2033AD as the 40th year.</p>  

<p>It is also interesting that God is speaking of the Israelites bearing their iniquities 40 years because that is partially the language of the Day of Atonement.  In Leviticus 16 God lays out the details for the Day of Atonement and there were to be two goats chosen. It says in Leviticus 16:7-10:</p>

<p class="verse">And he shall take the two goats, and present them before JEHOVAH <em>at</em> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for JEHOVAH, and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the JEHOVAH'S lot fell, and offer him <em>for</em> a sin offering. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before JEHOVAH, to make an atonement with him, <em>and</em> to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.</p> 

<p>Where were the Israelites? They were in the wilderness. Concerning the scapegoat, it refers to the Day of Atonement, which ties in with the Jubilee and the day the trumpet would sound to declare the Jubilee. But it also says in Leviticus 16:20-22:</p>

<p class="verse">And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy <em>place</em>, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat: And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send <em>him</em> away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.</p>

<p>The goat will have the sins of the children of Israel upon it and bear their iniquities and then it will be let go into the wilderness, a land not inhabited or desolate place.  It was exactly the punishment of God against the nation of Israel after they came out of Egypt. They murmured and God judged them and their carcasses fell in the wilderness. They bore their iniquities. So the 40-year timeline that the Israelites wandered in the wilderness could very well relate to the scapegoat which was to be released on the Day of Atonement. If it happened to be a Jubilee Year, it would still be the Day of Atonement that the scapegoat would be released and would bear the iniquity of the children of Israel.  God said that the Israelites bore their iniquities for 40 years.</p>

<p>It is interesting that in Ezekiel, chapter 4 God speaks of Israel and Judah bearing their iniquities, as it says in Ezekiel 4:4-6:</p>

<p class="verse">Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: <em>according</em> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.</p> 

<p>Here, again, we see a <em>“day for a year.”</em> But, more than that, we see the numbers <em>“39”</em> and <em>“40.”</em>  It says <em>“390 days,”</em> which is <em>“10 x 39,”</em> but it is basically the essence of that number.  Then he was to lie on his other side for 40 days. So, it is just like the 40 stripes that could not exceed and Paul received an actual 39 stripes; or, we have 40 calendar years from 7BC to 33AD, but actually 39 years and from 1994 to 2033 AD is 40 calendar years, but actually 39 years.  And, here in Ezekiel it was 390 days and then 40 days, featuring <em>“39”</em> and <em>“40.”</em></p>

<p>Now Mr. Camping mentioned that these two numbers – <em>“390”</em> and <em>“40”</em> – both had to coincide and fall on the same date. I do not know if this is correct and it is something worth looking into again, but Mr. Camping linked the <em>“40 days”</em> to Jacob and a timeline of <em>“4,000 years”</em> from the birth of Jacob in 2007BC to 1994AD, which is that Jubilee Year we are discussing and he linked the <em>“390 days”</em> to <em>“100 years”</em> when Jacob was 100 years old and God changed his name to <em>“Israel.”</em> From 1907BC there are 3,900 years until 1994AD, the Jubilee Year.</p>

<p>I think it is important to look at this because we have Israel bearing their iniquity and through these timelines it is tied to the Jubilee Year and the Jubilee Year and Day of Atonement when the iniquity was placed upon the head of the goat. And, remember, there are the sheep and the goats.  Who do the goats represent? They are the unsaved that have identification with the kingdom of God – the Israelites that were not saved or the New Testament church individuals that are not saved. So, they placed upon the head of the goat their own sins and they must bear their iniquities while they were being punished. The punishment of the Israelites in the wilderness was to wander about in a desolate land.</p>

<p>There is more information I was hoping to get to, but it does not look like we are going to have time.  Maybe we can just look quickly at an overall timeline. We have been looking at <em>“40,”</em> but, again, in our last study we spoke about 13BC, which was 11,000 years from creation. That had to be a key date because from 13BC to 7BC would be the 2,300-day period and then Christ was born. From 13BC to 33AD is a period of 45 actual years, but 46 calendar years. This would be the same as from creation in 11,013BC to the cross, which would be 11,045 actual years or 11,046 calendar years. From the date that was 23 years before the flood or 5013BC to the cross in 33AD was 5,045 actual years and 5,046 calendar years. And it is the same for creation to 2033AD. From 11,013 BC to 2033 is 13,045 actual years and 13,046 calendar years. Likewise, from 1988 to 2033 you have 45 actual years, but 46 inclusive years. So, there is another similarity with the overall time that we understand that judgment began at the house of God until the year 2033AD. There is a match there also with the timeline of the first coming of Christ and these other dates.</p>

<p>I will leave you with a verse in John, chapter 2. After thinking about that overall timeline of <em>“45 actual, but 46 inclusive years,”</em> you might be interested in reading John 2:19-21:</p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three 
days?</p> 

<p>But he spake of the temple of his body.</p>

<p>We know that Jesus’ body was in the earth for three days and three nights, but the temple of His body is much more than that. There is the spiritual temple, is there not? Christ has built a house, <em>“whose house are we.”</em>  We are the temple of God and, actually, this statement about the temple being in building for 46 years matches the timeline for the first coming of Christ from 13BC to the cross in 33AD and it matches the timeline from 1988 to 2033, so this is something that we will look into more and we will also relate it to a verse in Hosea. I will give you the verse so you can read it and study it.  It says in Hosea 6:1-3:</p>

<p class="verse">Come, and let us return unto JEHOVAH: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. Then shall we know, <em>if</em> we follow on to know JEHOVAH: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter <em>and</em> former rain unto the earth.</p> 

<p>The two periods of <em>“rain”</em> were the two outpourings of the Holy Spirit which identify with the two Jubilees.</p>
