<p>Hello and welcome to EBible Fellowship’s Sunday afternoon Bible study. Today we are going to take a break from our study in the Book of Daniel and we are going to turn our attention to some information we have looked at in the past regarding the Jubilee Year of 1994. We are also going to look at some information that we have not yet looked at, but which shows similarities between the first coming of Christ in 7BC and the likely coming of Christ to end the world. Let me rephrase this, as I do not want to say it is likely because at this time we are just making some observations as we see similarities.  Hopefully, we can look at this material objectively and take note.</p>

<p>Actually, it would probably be a good idea for you to get a pen and paper to take notes because I am going to mention some numbers and dates and it helps if you jot these things down to see the time relationships. You can also check them out, so I would encourage the listeners to write down the time references and the dates that are given and the length of years, and so forth.  Then you can always go back and review them. Also, if you listen to this study online from EBible’s website, you can pause the audio to jot down some of the numbers and then you can proceed where you left off. There will probably be a lot of dates and numbers given in this study, but that does not mean you cannot follow along. It may take a little while longer, but you can still do it.</p>

<p>Let us begin with some similarities between the first coming of Christ and the possibility of the second coming of Christ in 2033AD. First of all, let us look at the year 5013BC. You might be wondering what that has to do with anything. That date may not sound familiar to you and, yet, it is because 5013BC was the 6,000th year of earth’s history since creation. These dates are from the Biblical calendar of history which means they are derived from the Scriptures. The creation took place in 11,013BC, so 6,000 years later would have been 5013BC. From that point there was a 23-year period until 4990BC when the flood occurred.
</p>

<p>We often say that the flood took place in 4990BC, which was 6,000 years from creation, but we have not often looked at the date 5013BC and, yet, we are indicating that God observed a 23-year period prior to the flood – that would be the year 5013BC.  When we look at Biblical history, God did not go into any kind of detail and He does not give us any sort of a description of a tribulation of 23 years that led up to the flood. However, based on the timeline God, perhaps, was just prefiguring later tribulations, but He did observe it by simply not destroying the world in 5013BC. He waited 23 years more and then in 4990BC He brought His judgment with the flood. So, that means that the year 5013 is significant.</p>

<p>Likewise, 13BC is also a date that we often do not consider or think about that much and, yet, it is a date that is exactly 11,000 years from creation. In the Old Testament God used the number <em>“11”</em> at times to point to the first coming of Christ. Joshua’s death age and Joseph’s death age were both at 110 years and this number is <em>“10 x11”</em> and with other statements, too, God was pointing to the coming of Christ after 11,000 years of earth’s history. And, yet, that year 13BC was that 11,000th year. Not only that, but it was exactly 5,000 years between 13 BC and 5013BC, which began the 23-year period of tribulation prior to the flood, so we know it must be significant. And it is significant because the fullness of the 11,000th year directs us to 13BC and then if we go 2,300 days from 13BC, it is also significant as a tribulation period and it brings us to 7BC.  In the year 7BC Jesus was born into the world. All the Biblical evidence points to this and, not only that, it points to Jesus being born on the Day of Atonement, which was October 1, 7BC. It was very likely that Jesus was born either October 1 or October 2 in 7BC and 7BC was a Jubilee Year.</p>	
			
<p>Concerning Jubilee Years, God indicated something in Leviticus 25:9:</p>

<p class="verse">Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth <em>day</em> of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout <em>all</em> the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.</p> 

<p>The tenth day of the Hebrew seventh month, the Day of Atonement, the trumpet was to sound to signal the Jubilee in a Jubilee Year, which was every fiftieth year. The Jubilee Years first began to be observed in the year 1407BC when Israel entered into the Promised Land. That began a series of Jubilees which would take place every 50 years. Since the first one began in 1407BC, the next one would be 1357BC and the next one in 1307BC, and so on. That is how it was counted through the centuries and years ending in <em>“07”</em> or </em>“57”</em> would indicate a Jubilee year, so 7BC was a Jubilee Year. This was the pattern established by God from the time of the entrance into the land of Canaan. The trumpet would sound and all the captives were to be set free and it was a time of deliverance, which pointed to Jesus Christ because that is what Christ did through His salvation program for His elect people – He set the captives free that were captive to sin and to Satan. Jesus is the essence of the Jubilee and, therefore, it is the essence of the atonement. That is why God connected the two and on the Day of Atonement the Jubilee was to be brought in. We read in Romans 5:10-11:</p>

<p class="verse">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only <em>so</em>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</p>
     
<p>So, the atonement has everything to do with salvation and with the appeasing of the wrath of God and the satisfaction of the Law of God in atoning for the sins of the people of God, His elect. They were all the people that God chose before the world began and they were the people that Christ died for before the foundation of the world to pay the sin penalty. That was the atonement.</p.

<p>Jesus was very likely born on the Day of Atonement in a Jubilee Year because that was the time when the trumpet of the Jubilee would sound to announce deliverance of the captives. Remember the language about the <em>“acceptable year of JEHOVAH,”</em> in Isaiah 61:1:</p>

<p class="verse">The Spirit of JEHOVAH GOD <em>is</em> upon me; because JEHOVAH hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives…</p.

<p>That identifies this statement with the Jubilee. Liberty was to be proclaimed in all the land. It goes on to say in Isaiah 61:1-3:</p>

<p class="verse">…and the opening of the prison to <em>them that are</em> bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of JEHOVAH, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of JEHOVAH, that he might be glorified.</p>		
			
<p>The Gospel that brought glad tidings of good news to the people that were in spiritual bondage and captivity was identified as a time to proclaim liberty and proclaim <em>“the acceptable year of JEHOVAH.”</em> How long was the Jubilee to last? We read it in Leviticus 25:10-11:</p>

<p class="verse">And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout <em>all</em> the land unto all the inhabitants thereof…</p>

<p>The entire year was the Jubilee. It began on the Day of Atonement and lasted a full twelve months or one year. That was the “acceptable year of JEHOVAH,” because Christ was the essence of the atonement. He was born into the world and a Jubilee period would begin in 7BC and, yet, there were still many things for Jesus to do because He was just a baby. He had to develop and it had to fit with God’s timetable, so even though Jesus was born on the Day of Atonement in a Jubilee Year and, yet, when we think about it there was still be a long period of time before things developed. And we should think about it because God had made a point to announce Christ’s coming in 7BC. It was the date that the weary people of God longed for as they cried to God and besought Him for the Messiah. They were waiting for the coming of Christ and, finally, after 11,000 years plus the 2,300 days (6 years and 4 months) or a total of 11,006 years, He came into the world. God made the point of having this declared and announced. Remember the angels declared His glory to the shepherds that were watching their flocks by night. It was revealed to Simeon that he would not see death until he had seen the Lord’s Christ and Anna the prophetess spoke of Him to all those that were looking for redemption in Israel. God also gave advance information to the family of Zacharias and Elisabeth through the birth of John the Baptist. They would have told their families and friends. And what about Mary? She was told of the special visitation of the Holy Spirit concerning the child and she gave birth as a virgin. What an incredible thing and all her family and the people of God that she knew would have been fascinated by this news. The news of this miraculous birth would have spread.</p>  

<p>Then the child was born. The Messiah had come. It had been proclaimed. And then what happened? Nothing. Did the circumstances of God’s people change from being under foreign rule? Were they delivered from it? No – there was no change. What about the situation in Israel in regard to the apostate leaders of Israel? Were they delivered from it? No – there was no change.  Was there a change in the world? No – there was no change of any kind. Then came 6BC, 5BC, 4BC, 3BC, 2BC, 1BC and then came 1AD and 2AD and 5AD, and so on. There is no change, year after year after year. The people of God had heard. It had been proclaimed that the Messiah had come and, yet, for all intents and purposes, there was <em>“nothing.”</em> There was no interruption of their troubles, trials and tribulations and all the things they had hoped the Messiah would deliver them from and they were still in the same circumstances.  Some may have said, </em>“Let us give it more time.”</em>  Then came 10AD, 11AD, 12AD, 15AD and 20AD. Now it had been 26 years from the birth of Christ. I am counting down numbers, but remember that they do represent years that passed from the birth of the Messiah in 7BC. Then in 25AD it would have been 31 years and still no word – nothing. There was no further announcement from God and no miracles performed by Christ.</p>  

<p>I am sure there were some people that had heard the early reports about the Jubilee Year in 7BC and this baby that was born on the Day of Atonement. They got excited about it and they heard the shepherds’ report or they heard from Simeon or Anna or they heard from Zacharias himself. People believed it and trusted in it and they were excited, but over the course of time their excitement died down and began to dwindle to the point where some said, <em>“Oh, do not bring that up about the Messiah. We are 30 years down the road and nothing has happened. I do not want to hear any more about it.”</em> They were no longer interested in the event that took place in the Jubilee Year of 7BC.</p> 

The more time went on the more reasonable it seemed that they were correct in thinking it was <em>“nothing.”</em> If God were going to do anything, He would have done it by now. Then came 27AD and 28AD and now it was 34 years since 7BC. They may have said to a die-hard believer, <em>“Why are you still talking about that? It has been 34 years. When will you give it up? Just get on with your life. The Messiah will come, but it is clear that He did not come in 7BC.”</em> There would have been more and more falling away as each year passed. They would be saying, <em>“We were wrong. The people saying these things were not truthful men.”</em></p> 

<p>It is really just like what we hear today. We know that the nature of man has not changed and he has a tendency to murmur.  Just add a little period of time, like what happened with the Israelites in the wilderness, and it does not take long for them to murmur. Over the course of time, they are weary and tired and they forget about the deliverance and miracles and the power of God. It is as if they are saying to God, <em>“You have not done anything for me lately,”</em> and then the complaining starts and the falling away starts. We can be sure that the period of time after 7BC would have been a time when many that had heard were no longer willing to listen.</p>

<p>But then came 29AD and the period of time that began Jesus’ ministry. He was baptized by John the Baptist in the River Jordan and for the next three and one half years Jesus would go about all Israel and work many miracles to show people He was the very Christ, up until the cross in 33AD.</p>  

<p>The year 33AD is interesting, too, in its relationship to 7BC, is it not? You know, I heard Mr. Camping mention that David reigned 7 years in Hebron and then the place of his rule was transferred to Jerusalem, where he reigned for another 33 years.  That matches with the 7 years BC and then the 33 years AD. Also, the timeline from 7BC to 33AD is 40 calendar years <em>(7 + 33)</em>. However, in actual years it was only 39 years because you have to subtract <em>“1”</em> because there is no year <em>“zero,”</em> a mistake in the calendar. So, it was 39 actual years from 7BC, the Jubilee Year, when Christ came on the Day of Atonement (very likely) until 33AD when He went to the cross.</p>  

<p>I believe Jesus was just a little short of aged 39, but that is basically the timespan. Jesus went to the cross and then there was the Feast of Weeks that followed some fifty days later. Then on the Day of Pentecost (which is also called the Feast of Weeks), the Holy Spirit was poured out. We know that Peter preached one sermon and about 3,000 people became saved and the Jubilee was now in <em>“full swing.”</em>  Christ came and He was the essence of the Jubilee and the atonement, but God had a timetable for the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. The church age began on that Day of Pentecost in 33AD and it was all part of the first Jubilee. I know the Bible says that the Jubilee is a year and that relates to the acceptable year of the Lord, but God is able to elongate or stretch out a time period to make it much longer than an actual year or an actual day. That is His prerogative and He can do what He pleases, so He made the first Jubilee period to stretch from the birth of Christ into the New Testament church age and throughout the entire church age. The church age went from 33AD until 1988AD and that was a period of 1,955 years. That is a long Jubilee year, but that is basically what it was. It was the time that God saved people using the churches and congregations of the world and all those that were saved were likened to the firstfruits unto God.</p>

<p>We know that God has His program of times and seasons and we can see that with the first coming of Christ there are some very key dates. One of those key dates is 13BC, which was exactly 11,000 years from creation and another key date is the year 7BC which was the day Christ entered into the world in a Jubilee Year on the Day of Atonement. Other key dates are the year 29AD when He began His ministry and the year 33AD when He would go to the cross demonstrating the atonement; He performed the actual atoning work at the foundation of the world.  He came into the world to demonstrate this and the demonstration was completed on the cross when Jesus said, <em>“It is finished.”</em> Then His Spirit went to be with the Lord in heaven and His body went into the grave. We know that Jesus did not die in spirit and, therefore, according to Isaiah 53 there was no atoning work for sin being performed on the cross because Isaiah 53 said that He gave His soul an offering for sin. Yet, Christ’s soul did not die on the cross. He was alive on the cross and when His body died His soul went to heaven. He said to the thief next to Him, <em>“To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”</em> Jesus’ soul never died while He was on the cross. Of course, this proves that there was no payment being made for sin at that time, but from the foundation of the world He did die and His soul was made an offering for sin. That is why there was no need for His soul to die on the cross. Even His body saw no corruption in the tomb because the payment for sin had been made before the world was created.</p>

<p>Well, we see this timeline. We see 13BC and 7BC. Then we have this long period of years until the work of Christ would begin in 29AD and His three and one half years of ministry and His going to the cross in 33AD.</p>

<p>Now let us look at some similarities with some dates with which we are familiar from the timeline derived from the Biblical calendar of history. Let us start with the year 1988. That year was the 13,000th year of earth’s history. Again, when we look back the year 5013BC was the 6,000th year of earth’s history and the year 13BC was the 11,000th year of earth’s history and both of those periods were used by God to begin a <em>“tribulation”</em> that would lead to the flood in 4990BC and lead to the birth of the Messiah in 7BC, 2300 days later from 13BC.  The year 1988 was the 13,000th year of earth’s history and that was also the year the church age ended or the first Jubilee (first outpouring of the Holy Spirit) came to a close. That is when the Tribulation came in and during the first 2,300 days there was a grievous period in which virtually no one was being saved. It was also a time when there was no <em>“rain”</em> and no <em>“season.”</em> There had been the time of firstfruits that had just ended on May 21, 1988, the day before Pentecost. The early rain ceased to fall. At that point God was not saving anyone within any of the churches of the world. The Holy Spirit had come out of the midst of the churches and Satan had entered in and virtually no one outside the churches was being saved. We have to say <em>“virtually”</em> because the Bible speaks of <em>“a half hour of silence”</em> in Revelation, chapter 8 and the word <em>“silence”</em> does allow for the slightest bit of noise. It could be that no one at all was saved, but we make that allowance because the Bible does lead us in that direction, but for 2,300 evening mornings, a period of about six years and four months, there was virtually no one being saved until October 7, 1994.</p>

<p>So, just as we had 13BC and 2,300 evening mornings leading up to 7BC, a Jubilee Year, we have the year 1988 and the 2,300 evening mornings leading up to 1994. What was special about the year 1994? It was a Jubilee Year. As I mentioned earlier, in the Old Testament the Jubilee Years would end in the numbers <em>“57”</em> or <em>“07”</em> in every century. The year 7BC was the year Christ was born and that was the last Jubilee on the Old Testament side of the cross. It was the 28th Jubilee since 1407BC. By the way, from 7BC to 1994 is 2,000 years and if you break down the number <em>“2,000”</em> into Jubilees, it is <em>“40 x 50,”</em> because every fifty years is a Jubilee Year and 1994 would be the 68th overall Jubilee and you can break down that number to <em>“4 x 17.”</em>  The number <em>“4”</em> would point to the furthest extent of what is in view and the number <em>“17”</em> has to with heaven, as the Jubilee has everything to do with saving people and bringing them to heaven.</p>  

<p>When we project the Jubilee into the New Testament era from 7BC, you take <em>“7”</em> and add </em>“44”</em> years, which is <em>“51”</em> and then you have to subtract <em>“1”</em> because there is no year <em>“zero.”</em> So the year 44AD was a Jubilee Year and then 50 years later it was in 94AD. Then in the following century, it would be in <em>“144”</em> and </em><em>“194”</em> and in the second century, it would be <em>“244”</em> and <em>“294.”</em> So in the 20th century, it was <em>“1944”</em> and <em>“1994.”</em> The next Jubilee would be <em>“2044,”</em> if we were to reach it, but <em>“1994”</em> was a Jubilee Year that stands in a special relationship to the Jubilee in which Christ was born in 7BC because the first coming of Christ was after 11,000 years plus 2,300 days. Since the Bible relates the number <em>“13”</em> to the second coming of Christ and the end of the world, we would expect that when we got to the 13,000th year (the fullness) in 1988 and apply the same pattern of 2,300 evening mornings, we have another Jubilee in 1994. That relationship between 1994 and 7 BC and between 1988 and 13BC is unique. They stand in exactly the same position some 2,000 years later.  As a matter of fact, from 13BC to 1988 is exactly 2,000 years and from 7BC to 1944 is exactly 2,000 years. (Remember you have to minus <em>“1”</em> when you add the two numbers together between BC and AD years.)  So they stand sort of parallel to one another, separated by 2,000 years, just as 33AD is separated by 2,000 years from 2033AD and that is why we have to seriously look at the year 2033AD as the possible year that Christ will return to complete the second Jubilee, which we will talk about in a minute.</p>	

<p>You know, deliverance of the captives is not complete until God has completed His entire salvation which involves the resurrection of our bodies. If it were the case that it is 2033AD when Christ takes His people to heaven and equips them with new resurrected bodies, it is part of saving them or of delivering them. That is part of what Jesus came to do as the Jubilee and it would be the completion of His work. He is the one that made atonement for us and set us free from sin, but at the time of the resurrection of our bodies we will finally be set free from sin in our physical bodies and that is related to the Jubilee and the work that Christ performs.</p>  

<p>We have two dates, 1988 and 1994, that are 2,000 years into the future from 13BC and 7BC, respectively, and we have 7BC and 1994AD as Jubilee Years, so on September 7, 1994 God, once again, indicated a Jubilee Year. It was another outpouring of the Holy Spirit, a second time, and the Bible speaks of a mysterious <em>“second time”</em> in Isaiah 11:10-11:</p>

<p class="verse">And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious. And it shall come to pass in that day, <em>that</em> the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.</p> 
  
<p>Also, we read in the Book of Jonah that God commanded Jonah to go to Nineveh, but Jonah fled in a ship to Tarshish. Then God stopped him with the raging sea and He caused the mariners to cast him overboard where he was swallowed by a whale. The whale vomited him out on dry land and the dry land happened to be Nineveh, where the Lord had wanted him to go. It says in Jonah 3:1-2:
</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the second time, saying, Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</p>

<p>God emphasizes <em>“the second time.”</em> One of the interesting things about the historical account that we find in the Book of Jonah is Jonah’s name. His name is Strong’s #3124 and if you look up Strong’s #3123 it has the identical spelling in both the consonants and vowel pointing. They are exactly the same word and that word is translated as <em>“dove.”</em> That is significant because God likens the Holy Spirit to a <em>“dove.”</em> It says in Mark 1:10:</p>

<p class="verse">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p>

<p>God records this in each of the four Gospel accounts. It says, <em>“The Spirit like a dove,”</em> and since God defines His own terms we have to look at the idea of the Holy Spirit whenever we see that word. What happened on the Day of Pentecost? The Holy Spirit was poured out the first time. The <em>“dove,”</em> as it were, went out into the world to deliver His people during that First Jubilee. Then in 1994, a Jubilee year, after the grievous 2,300 evening mornings, God poured out the Holy Spirit a second time. It was a second Jubilee. It was as though the <em>“dove”</em> is now going a second time into the world. God comes to Jonah (the dove) a second time and commands him to go to Nineveh, which would represent the world: <em>“Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.”</em></p>

<p>Then it says in Jonah 3:3:</p>

<p class="verse">So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of JEHOVAH. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.</p>

<p>Jonah obediently went forth into the city of Nineveh the second time God commanded it and this relates to the second outpouring of the Holy Spirit, just like the first outpouring began with a Jubilee and the birth of Christ and extended all the way to 1988, the end of the church age. From September 7, 1994 there would also be an extended period of a Jubilee. It would take place over the second part of the Great Tribulation, but the Great Tribulation is only a <em>“little season,”</em> so the extension of time would not last very long. It lasted almost 17 years to May 21, 2011 and then God ended the Latter Rain and the Great Tribulation came to a close, but the second Jubilee or second outpouring of the Holy Spirit began in the Jubilee Year of 1994. God sent forth His Spirit and moved His people to bring the Gospel to the world and it was His plan to save a great multitude of people.</p>

<p>Now we have to look at another interesting thing. From that first Jubilee of 7BC until 33AD when God would officially begin the outpouring of the Holy Spirit the first time was 40 calendar years, but 39 actual years. I think I mentioned that before. From 1994AD, a Jubilee Year until 2033AD (which is the possible time of the coming of the Lord Jesus) is 40 inclusive years, but 39 actual years.</p>  

<p>I would suggest that you write down the years starting with 1994 and ending with 2033. Mark the year 1994 as number 1, and so forth, and the year 2033 will be 40 years, but if it is actual years, then you count 1994 to 1995 as <em>“year 1,”</em> so 1995 would be <em>“year 1.”</em> That is 39 actual years. This matches with the 40 calendar years or 39 actual years in the relationship of 7BC to Christ going to the cross in 33AD, so we another match 2,000 years apart: 33AD to 2033AD. In other words, the years 1988, 1994 and 2033 sit in extremely similar way to the years 13BC, 7BC and 33AD. They are separated by 2,000 years, so they are positioned in a very identical way with one another and both have Jubilee Years and periods in fullness of thousands in which a Tribulation began, with 2,300 days until the Jubilee, from 11,000 years to 11,006 when Christ came and from 13,000 to 13,006 when the second outpouring of the Jubilee occurred in 1994, and so forth. So they are standing in very similar places, separated by two millennium.</p>

<p>We also heard reports back in 1994. When we look at the Biblical evidence there is much more, so maybe we will do at least one more study to look at some other interesting things about 1994 and the Day of Atonement and the release on the Day of Atonement into the wilderness. The release of that goat into the wilderness ties into judgment on the unsaved and that took place on the Day of Atonement and it would have occurred in a Jubilee Year as well. So when we look at the fact that there was this sort of <em>“announcement”</em> that occurred back in 1994 about the coming of Christ and then it died down. Yes, we know that with the coming of May 21, 2011 it kind of picked up urgency again, but when we look at the span of years (and it is now the year 2016) it is now some 24 years from 1994, the Jubilee Year. Keep in mind that the Jews back in the 1st century were waiting all that time for God to work and, seemingly, nothing was happening. Nothing was taking place. Likewise, that is how we feel. We look back at these dates and the interesting information that came forth from the Bible and, therefore, it came forth from God and we feel that it has not happened and, yet, there was a possibility that there is an overarching or overreaching timeline. Yes, we were focused on the 23 years of the Tribulation and then we were focused on the 10,000 days leading to October 7, 2015, but it could be that overreaching all these things is another timeline.</p>

<p>Remember that was the problem Moses had because based on the Bible and what God had said to Abram in Genesis, he was looking at the 400-year period as the time of deliverance or the time that God had told Abram would come after they were afflicted 400 years. In the year 390 when Moses was 40 years old, he thought, <em>“We have only 10 years left,”</em> but it was too soon. There was more information and there was an overarching timeline that he was unaware of which made the total duration they would spend in Egypt 430 years, so he was off by 40 years. But after 430 years, to the selfsame day, God brought them forth. Many Jews in their grievous bondage were crying to God and, perhaps, they were excited with Moses for a while and then they just gave up: <em>“How long, O Lord?”</em></p>	
			
<p>And, yet, God was working with a set timetable that they were unaware of and, yet, they were correct in looking for the time, but it would not be until after Moses went out into the desert for 40 years. Then it was revealed by God that it was time for Moses to return to Egypt.</p>

<p>Well, we have been correct. I have never doubted, by God’s grace, that we were correct in looking for and hasting unto the coming day of God and looking for these things. I have never felt even for a moment that looking into the Bible for the coming of Christ was somehow sinful. We have been correct. Is it just a matter that it is a longer period of time in which we need to step back and look at something that extends a little further into the future?</p>
