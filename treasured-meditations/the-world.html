<p>Typically, the object of God's wrath is exposed and publicly ridiculed. During the time of God's judgment on the churches (May 21, 1988 thru May 21, 2011) there were constant public scandals which brought shame upon the church institution. The media was one of the tools used by God to expose the church's sins and to bring it (the corporate church) public shame.</p>

<p>Since Jesus Christ was no longer in their midst to protect them, overwhelmingly, during the 23 year judgment on the house of God, the churches were the focus of negative attention. Mockers ravaged the churches for their scandals and foolishness.</p> 

<p>The world's reaction was one of rejoicing:</p>

<p class="verse">Revelation 11:9-10 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</p>

<p>The church institution, once established by God, and long a cause of grief to the inhabitants of the world for shining a light into their preferred darkness, had lost its power. In a similar way as to Samson after his hair was cut off, the world was now making sport of them. Without God on their side they had no defense against the many attacks of the fowls of the air coming down to pick at their dead carcass:</p>

<p class="verse">Matthew 24:28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. </p>

<p>But on May 21, 2011, it all changed. The judgment which had been exclusively upon the churches of the world, now expanded to include all unsaved mankind.</p>

<p>The cup of wrath that the Lord first administered to the people called by His name, was not extended to all nations:</p>

<p class="verse">Jeremiah 25:17-18 Then took I the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me: <em>To wit</em>, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as <em>it is</em> this day;</p>

<p class="verse">Jeremiah 25:29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>The spiritual cup of wrath that the churches had been drinking was now given to the nations. All nations of the world, or all of Satan's kingdom (spiritual Babylon) were to now drink of the cup of the wrath of God. In the Day of Judgment, the tables are turned. The mockers have become the ones mocked:</p>

<p class="verse">Revelation 18:6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</p> 

<p>In the days to come, we can expect that any organization or institution, or philosophy, that identifies with the world will exposed to ridicule. It will lose respect and honor and be brought low. This happens to all who are the objects of the wrath of God.</p>

<p>God's judgment is focused on the world at large. This is why the attention has turned away from the corporate church and towards the religion of Islam.</p>

<p>Judaism, and Christianity were once religions that truly represented the kingdom of God on earth. Islam, or the Muslim religion has never been an outward representation of God's kingdom. Therefore the religion of Islam is a religion of the world.</p>

<p>And it is the biggest or most populous of all the world's religions (a part from Christianity that was a religion established by God and as such was not a 'world' religion at all).</p>

<p>Isn't it curious, that over the last several years various groups connected to the religion of Islam have come into the public eye of the world, not for good reasons, but for constant acts of terrorism and for things that cast that religion in a negative light.</p>

<p>In fact, the news media (the world's mouthpiece) has reluctantly been forced to report on negative act after negative act. By the way, if any wonder why the news media is reluctant to report negatively on the religion of Islam, it is because they represent the same entity (i.e. the world). And so they take no joy (as they did when reporting on constant troubles of the Christian church during its period of judgment) in reporting on these things against the religion that most represents the world itself.</p>

<p>Since we've entered into Judgment Day (it began on May 21, 2011) the religion in the cross hairs as the object of God's wrath is no longer the Christian church (it also has become part of the world and is under wrath but not the prime target anymore), but it is the religion of Islam. Again, the reason for this is because Islam represents the world's religious system. And all facets of the world are under the judgment of God. God is publicly exposing them and bringing shame upon them.</p> 

<h4>THE CUP OF GOD’S WRATH AND MOCKERY</h4>

<p>Mockery (public shaming) is often in view when it comes to drinking of the cup of the wrath of God.</p>

<p>Christ drinks of the cup of God's wrath:</p>

<p class="verse">Matthew 26:39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>

<p>Christ is mocked before going to the cross:</p>

Matthew 27:27-31 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band <em>of soldiers</em>. And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put <em>it</em> upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>The churches drank of the cup of God's wrath. The churches experienced mockery also:</p>

<p>Judah, picturing the churches, drinks of the cup of the wrath of God:</p>

<p class="verse">Jeremiah 25:17 Then took I the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me: 18 To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah,...</p>

<p>While the church was under this awful judgment many in the world mocked:</p>

<p class="verse">Jude 18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. 19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</p>

<p>Mockery and drinking of the cup of wrath go hand in hand.</p>

<p>The Roman soldiers mocked Christ. The people of the world mocked the church. But who is it that will mock the world during their period of drinking of the cup of the wrath of God? Certainly it cannot be God's elect. The Lord forbids that type of behavior to occur among His people. He will not allow the elect to engage in mocking the world's fallen condition. That would be taking delight in their death, and God takes no delight in the death of the wicked. And since He takes no delight in their death the child of God likewise cannot delight in it either:</p>

<p class="verse">Ezekiel 33:11 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked;...</p>

<p class="verse">Ecclesiastes 12:1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;</p> 

<p>This seems to be a difficulty, the Bible teaches that the world is presently drinking of the cup of God's wrath. And the Bible also indicates that mockery or public shame accompanies the drinker of that cup. However, as we look at it, it would seem that only God's elect are in the position to mock the world. And yet, God's elect are not permitted to engage in that sort of behavior.</p>

<p>How will this work out?</p>

<h4>NO NEED TO FIGHT (MOCK) IN THIS BATTLE</h4>

<p>The answer is found in a few Scriptures that describe the Day of Judgment as a time of in fighting between the unsaved people of the world. Here's one verse that speaks of this:</p>

<p class="verse">Zechariah 14:12-13 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; ...  And it shall come to pass in that day, <em>that</em> a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.</p>

<p>Who fought against Jerusalem (the corporate church)? It was Satan and his forces or Gog and Magog. And because it speaks of God judging those that fought against Jerusalem we can know that that battle (when judgment was upon the house of God) has completed. And now a new battle of God against those nations has begun. That new battle is the final judgment of the nations of the world. It is Judgment Day.</p>

<p>And in Judgment Day "they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor". It is the unsaved against the unsaved.</p>

<p>Remember when good king Jehoshaphat (type of Christ) lead the people of Judah (type of the elect) into battle against several approaching enemy nations (the world or kingdom of Satan). God explained to them that they would have no need to fight in this battle.</p>

<p class="verse">2 Chronicles 20:14 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; 15 And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle <em>is</em> not yours, but God's. 16 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel. 17 Ye shall not <em>need</em> to fight in this <em>battle</em>: set yourselves, stand ye <em>still</em>, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD <em>will be</em> with you.</p>

<p>First of all, in order to prove that this battle did indeed picture the final battle at the end of the world, let's turn to:</p>

<p class="verse">Joel 3:12-14 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about. Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness <em>is</em> great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD <em>is</em> near in the valley of decision.</p>

<p>We see that God sat to judge the nations (heathen) in the valley of Jehoshaphat and that the language of the Day of the Lord is tied to it.</p>

<p>Historically, this would have been an amazing thing to behold. The Lord instructed them to go forth to face an approaching enemy army of tremendous numbers and strength, and to do so with the expectation that they would not fight themselves in the battle. The army of Judah obeyed (their obedience highlights the fact that they do typify God's elect) and went forth with singing:</p>

<p class="verse">2 Chronicles 20:20-22 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever. And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.</p>

<p>They were smitten. But who smote them? The answer is in the next verse:</p>

<p class="verse">2 Chronicles 20:23-24 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy <em>them</em>: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another. And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.</p>

<p>These enemy nations, who originally, were all coming against Judah (Christ and His elect people) somehow managed to destroy one another. Each man set his hand against his neighbor, and his neighbor's hand against him.</p>

<p>Now we know, from Zechariah 14:13 and from 2 Chronicles 20:23, both passages which address Judgment Day, that God tells us that mankind will fight and destroy one another in that day.</p>

<p>But how will this happen?</p>

<p>What have we learned that accompanies the drinking of the cup of God's wrath? It is mockery. Or public shaming that accompanies it. And mockery is something that God's elect people cannot engage in, in any way. That is, we will not fight (mock) in this battle. That is not for us to do.</p>

<p>Instead, God will set the hand of unsaved man against the hand of his fellow unsaved man, and they will fight and destroy (mock) one another. At present, we are witnessing this righteous judgment of God taking place in the world.</p>
