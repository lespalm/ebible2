<h4>SPEAKING OF JUDGMENT DAY</h4>

<p>Speaking of Judgment Day, we read: 
<p class="verse">Luke 17:30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</p>

<p>The Greek word translated as 'revealed' means just that---to reveal as in the word revelation.</p>

<p class="verse">Romans 2:5b "...the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;"</p>

<p>The word 'revelation' has to do with revealing truth from the Bible. 
Question for critics of May 21, 2011 being the start of Judgment Day: why does God speak of the <em>"day of wrath"</em> (i.e. Judgment Day) as also a time of <em>"revelation"</em> of His righteous judgment?</p>
<hr>

<h4>THE TRUTH IS THAT SALVATION IS OVER AND DONE WITH</h4>

<p>Hope and waiting upon God had its time. During the time God was longsuffering patient with mankind. Before He received the early and latter rain. But now the rain is over and done. The seasons of firstfruits and ingathering have been completed. God ceased to be longsuffering and patient on May 21, 2011. That was the start of Judgment Day for this world.</p>

<p>They can find numerous verses that had their period of application during the extended era of salvation for this world. Just like I could find verses that command people to go to Jerusalem three times a year, or to offer sacrifices on occasion. Scriptures commanding those things are numerous. But we know that we're not to offer sacrifices any longer because that time has past. Likewise, we know today that we're not to cry out for mercy that God save us, or our loved ones, that time too has passed.</p>

<p>They're encouraging people that God is still saving today may make them feel good. It may seem as if they're doing something good for people. A kindness even. However the truth is that lies are never good nor kind. Encouraging people to waste their time in beseeching God to save them is no more loving than people that say God loves everyone and has a wonderful plan for their lives. Or that Christ died for everyone. Sounds wonderful. Very soothing and psychologically uplifting. The only problem is that its completely false and not worth the breathe the individual exhaled to say it.</p>

<p>Its never truly a good thing, nor a kindness when we go contrary to God's Holy Word the Bible. The truth is always the best thing for the listener, even if its something grievous that they don't like to hear.</p.

<p>The truth is, salvation is over and done with. This information, because it is true, is what feeds God's sheep in this time of the final judgment.</p>
<hr>

<h4>GOD CONTROLS THE DOOR TO HEAVEN</h4>

<p>God is the Judge. The Bible is the Word of God. And in that Word of God He has made known His judgment upon the world and in it He also made known the timeline for the beginning of that judgment (May 21, 2011, Judgment Day!).</p> 

<p>The judgment of God concerns the door of heaven. Christ (the Word) is the Door. And because He is the Door Himself He controls everything to do with that door. When its open, He lets His people know. And when its open greatly, as it was during the latter rain people, He lets His people know that also. And when God shuts the door to the churches He lets His people know that information as well. And of course, God also revealed to His elect people the status of the door for the world on the day of May 21, 2011.</p> 

<p>Its easy to charge the elect child of God with exceeding their bounds because they say that the Bible teaches that the door to heaven is now shut. Yet, the same can be said of those that dare to say the door is now open simply based upon their own personal feelings or ideas, which are in clear contradiction to the Bible’s teaching that the doorway is in fact closed. Saying the door is open or shut, of itself is not wrong. The error comes when the declaration of the door’s status goes contrary to what the Bible has decreed.</p> 

<p>Many act as though God has not opened up the Scriptures to reveal much truth that locked in the date that the door of heaven would shut. These things were not done in a corner somewhere. They were done openly, boldly, God had His people proclaim to the world that on that date the door to heaven would shut once and for all.</p> 

<p class="verse">Genesis 7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.</p>

<p>God did indeed shut the door on the very day that He said He would. The elect people of God, as humble and faithful stewards of the door (the Word of God the Bible) simply proclaim its status as revealed by the Lord to His servants:</p>

<p class="verse">Psalm 84:10 For a day in thy courts <em>is</em> better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</p>

<p>Perhaps many think they can control the openings and shuttings of that heavenly portal, but the fact is that they cannot. No man can. And God's elect would never even dare to try. We're simply doorkeepers. God tells us the door's condition (through His Word the Bible) and we report it to others.</p> 

<p class="verse">Revelation 3:7 ... These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</p>

<p>I'm sorry many don't like what God has done. They have better ideas and seem to think their wisdom is greater than God's. Yes, they wouldn't do things this way. But its not their gospel is it? And its not their door to heaven. Its God's. He is sovereign in every area of His salvation program. He is sovereign regarding those whom He saved. Where He chose to save them. And when He determined to save them.</p> 

<p>He is God. He has revealed many things concerning His program for Judgment Day. It starts with the absolute fact that heaven's door has been shut and His salvation program has come to an end. No one will make any real spiritual progress in these days after the tribulation until they humble themselves before that awesome and glorious Bible truth.</p>
<hr>

<h4>A TIME FOR GOD TO SAVE, AND A TIME FOR GOD TO JUDGE</h4>

<p class="verse">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 To every <em>thing there is</em> a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:  A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up <em>that which is</em> planted;  A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;  A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;  A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;  A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;  A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;  A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</p>

<p>They're out of sync. The things many are saying about 'good news' have had their time of fulfillment during the Day of Salvation. May 21, 2011 has brought us to another time. The Day of Judgment. There is no more good news for anyone that is unsaved. This time period is the time for unsaved mankind to die. It is the time for that which has been planted to be plucked up. It is the time for God to kill in judgment (and not to heal in salvation); it is the time of breaking down, and the casting of stones, etc, etc.</p> 

<p>I am truly sorry that the Lord has not opened up their eyes to these things. We read in John 9:4:</p>
 
<p class="verse">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p> 

<p>The day is over. The night has come. The work of Christ in saving (this is the work of God that ye believe--John 6:29) can no longer be performed.</p>
<hr>

<h4>BOLDNESS IN THE DAY OF JUDGMENT</h4>

<p class="verse">1 John 4:17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment:</p>

<p>For any that are so certain that May 21, 2011 was NOT the start of Judgment Day for the world, please feel free to explain why the Word of God speaks of the need for God's elect to have <em>"boldness in the day of judgment"</em>?</p>
 
<p>By the way, the word 'boldness' is a word that is most often used in the context of sharing God's Word the Bible in which there is much hostility towards it.</p.

<p class="verse">Acts 4:29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</p>

<p>Since they lived in a time of intense persecution against them we can definitely understand why the apostles prayed for 'boldness' to share the Word of God as they did; but why in the world would there be a need for God's elect to have BOLDNESS IN THE DAY OF JUDGMENT? Curious, isn't it?</p>
