<p>Welcome to EBible Fellowship’s Bible study in the Book of Genesis.  This is study #4 of Genesis, chapter 3 and we are going to read Genesis 3:1-6:</p>

<p class="verse">Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which JEHOVAH God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which <em>is</em> in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree <em>was</em> good for food, and that it <em>was</em> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make <em>one</em> wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</p> 

<p>I will stop reading there.  In our last study I commented at the end of the study how Eve did not really put up much of a struggle.  She did not put forth much resistance at all toward the serpent’s statements and what he wanted her to do in eating of the tree which God had commanded, <em>“Thou shalt not eat of it.”</em>  The serpent did not have to force her, beat her or pin her down or do anything like that.  He did not even have to convince her with a point-by-point discussion – it was very simple and easy for the serpent to deceive her.  He came and got her talking about the tree and then he contradicted God and he lied to her when he said, <em>“Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”<em>  It was the lie that convinced her.  It was the belief and acceptance of the lie.  It was choosing the lie over what God had said and what God had said was true.  God had said, <em>“But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”</em>  This was truth, but what the serpent brought to light was not true in any way.  The serpent gave the appearance of wisdom, as he was more subtil than any beast of the field.  He acted as though he had knowledge and understanding as a prudent creature that had the <em>“inside information.”</em>  He had the knowledge concerning that tree, but what he told Eve was a lie.</p>  

<p>We understand that there is truth and then there is that which is not true and Satan, as the enemy of God, found his method of attack in that which was deceitful and a lie.  This is why Jesus said of the Jews that were not saved, in John 8:33-41:</p>

<p class="verse">They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <em>but</em> the Son abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father…</p>

<p>Christ accused them twice of being like their <em>“father.”</em>  First, he said they did which they have seen of their father and then he said they do the deeds of their father.</p>

<p>Then it goes on to say in John 8:41-45:</p>

<p class="verse">…Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <em>even</em> God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? <em>even</em> because ye cannot hear my word.  Ye are of <em>your</em> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell <em>you</em> the truth, ye believe me not.</p> 

<p>What a tremendous indictment this is from the Lord Jesus Christ to the (unbelieving) Jews of his time, but more than that, it is the truth about every unsaved individual in the world: <em>“Ye are of your father the devil, the father of lies.”</em>  Therefore, if someone is of their father and they do the things they have seen of their father and they perform the deeds of their father, they will lie because their father the devil was a liar from the beginning.  When he lies he speaks of his own.  He is a liar and the father of lies and mankind that was in Adam and Eve during that short window period before they sinned had an opportunity (not to sin) at the point of Satan’s temptation when he brought forth the lie.  That is what a <em>“father”</em> does – he begets a child.  Satan, the serpent, gave birth to <em>“the lie.”</em>  It was born in time on that day in the year 11,013BC which was over 13,000 years ago.  Satan approached the woman and said, <em>“Ye shall not surely die.”</em>  Then he elaborated on his lie by saying that God knew that in the day they would eat thereof their eyes would be opened.  This was a <em>“half-truth,”</em> was it not?  Their eyes would be opened to <em>“evil,”</em> to the knowledge and experience of wrongdoing and transgression against God.  Their eyes would be opened to wickedness and sin and to everything that is ungodly, unholy, filthy, dirty and rotten.  That is what their eyes would be opened to experience – misery, pain, grief and untold sorrows that would come upon them and their descendants.  The veil of tears would come upon all mankind as man would know and experience evil.</p>  

<p>We see it today, as never before in history.  In their perversion, unsaved people would love to live in our day to witness and gain knowledge of the tremendous evil that has spread across the face of the earth.  In one sense, this is what man has wanted and desired.  It is why there is within the fallen human being this corrupt tendency to want to <em>“know evil.”</em>  It is why we consume evil doings in the news.  It is why people write stories that are full of wickedness.  It is why television and movies are saturated with murder, adultery, stealing and lying.  It is all evil and we want to consume it on our lusts.  We want to devour it and know more evil.  It is a part of us since Adam and Eve (and we in them) made that dreadful decision when mankind could have had a choice and when there was an option to choose good and truth over the lie.  There was a will within man at that time which was free because he was not constrained by iniquity and he was not dead in sins, so he could have chosen to continue to trust and obey God.  He could have said what Jesus said when the devil tempted him in the wilderness.  Jesus quoted Scripture to him and Satan attempted to twist the Scriptures, but Jesus quoted more Scriptures in response.  That would have been the correct way to respond to Satan in the garden, but man did not do so.</p>

<p>Of course, we know this was all within the ultimate purpose and will of God, as God designed things for this earth.  It was all to play out in order for God to present the magnificent Saviour and the magnificent salvation program in order to purchase a people for Him.  Yet, that does not change the fact that at this one point of time when the serpent came to tempt Eve and Adam…by the way, I used to think (before I read this more carefully) that Satan came to Eve when she was alone and he found her at a moment when her husband was not around, but that is not true.  It says at the end of Genesis 3:6: <em>“she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.”</em>  He was not on the other side of the garden.  He was not <em>“out of town.”</em>  He was standing next to her and he was right there as the serpent was having this conversation with the woman and he could have intervened at any point.  Besides being our figurehead and representative, he is in fault for not intercepting on behalf of his wife, because Adam was the head of his household.  This was especially true when Adam heard Satan lie and contradict God.  He should have said, <em>“We do not want to hear anything more.”</em></p> 

<p>The Lord tells us something in the 2John:10-11:</p>

<p class="verse">If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into <em>your</em> house, neither bid him God speed: For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>

<p>The serpent was coming with <em>“another gospel.”</em>  If we were to define what the Gospel is, it is the truth of the Word of God, the Bible, and we have the whole Bible today.  The Gospel for Adam and Eve was the truth of God’s commandment concerning that tree and every other statement God had made to them, but especially that command.  It was the Law of God and the Law of God is synonymous with the Gospel.  God had given the Law regarding that tree, but here came the serpent with <em>“another gospel.”</em>  He has a different conclusion than the true Gospel that God had delivered to this couple, the only human beings on the planet.  It was <em>“another gospel”</em> and the serpent came to their <em>“house,”</em> as it were, and they should have shut the door on him.  They should have said, <em>“We cannot talk to you,”</em> in the moment that that serpent lied to them.  In the moment he did that, he was presenting <em>“another Christ”</em> or <em>“another gospel.”</em>  God points this out as He moved the Apostle Paul to refer back to this incident in Genesis and He related it to the New Testament believers in 2Corinthians 11:1-2:</p>

<p class="verse">Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <em>my</em> folly: and indeed bear with me. For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <em>you as</em> a chaste virgin to Christ.</p> 

<p>God is moving Paul to speak to the bride of Christ.  All those Jesus has saved are espoused to Him and we are presented as a <em>“chaste virgin”</em> because our sins have been washed away and, therefore, there is no adultery or fornication in this spiritual marriage.  It goes on to say in 2Corinthians 2:3:</p>

<p class="verse">But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</p> 

<p>We can see a parallel picture being drawn between the serpent coming to Eve and Satan coming to professed believers of the New Testament church throughout the church age and even into the time of the end.  Then it says in 2Corinthians 11:4:</p>

<p>For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <em>if</em> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <em>him</em>.</p> 

<p>Notice that the Apostle Paul is saying that if someone comes preaching <em>“another Jesus,”</em> and he makes it synonymous with preaching <em>“another gospel.”</em>  That is why it says in Matthew 24 that there would be <em>“false Christs.”</em>  It is really saying there would be <em>“false gospels.”</em>  It has to do with people preaching <em>“another Christ”</em> or <em>“another Jesus.”</em>  The point Paul is making is that if someone comes to you preaching <em>“another Jesus,”</em> whom we have not preached” or <em>“another spirit”</em> or <em>“another gospel,”</em> you <em>“might well bear with”</em> these people; that is, you might be kind and patient and you might put up with these preachers or elders or deacons – you might be forbearing with them.  But, you are not to give them heed and you are not to invite them into your <em>“house”</em> and that can apply to the house of God (during the church age) or your own individual house.  You have to tell them to <em>“hit the road.”</em>  You have to tell them, <em>“I cannot listen to you.”</em>  The sin of Adam and Eve was that they did <em>“well bear with him”</em> as they listened to the serpent.  They gave him audience.  They allowed him into their <em>“house”</em> and when he began to lay out his fictional story and his outright lie they bore with him.  They were following along.  They allowed him to say this and that and that is what Eve did in Genesis 3:6:</p>

<p class="verse">And when the woman saw that the tree <em>was</em> good for food, and that it <em>was</em> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make <em>one</em> wise…</p>

<p>Where did she get that bit of information that the tree would <em>“make one wise”</em>?  She got it right from the serpent’s mouth when he told her, <em>“For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”</em>  She thought it was <em>“a tree to be desired to make one wise.”</em>  She played around with sin.  She played around with <em>“another gospel.”</em>  First, she had known the true Gospel.  She was familiar with what God had said concerning the tree and she was soundly grounded in that true Gospel, but here came the serpent and she made error after error.  As soon as the serpent said something contrary to what God had said, the conversation should have ended.  <em>“No thank you.”</em></p>

<p>You know, in the past I have sometimes felt bad when someone comes to the EBible group on Facebook and they posted lies about their beliefs, teachings and doctrines.  Sometimes it is lies and is another gospel.  We kindly ask them not to post these things, but, typically, they continue to post because what normally goes along with this is a lot of pride.  They are proud of what they think they know and they want other people to listen to them.  In these days when the church age is over and there is no church authority, they respond, <em>“You are not my authority.  I will post what I want.”</em>  They can do that on their own page or website, but we have to kick them out of the EBible group.  Sometimes people complain that EBible is not a democracy.  It is not a <em>“free for all.”</em>  We do not let people just say whatever is on their minds.  Where in the Bible does God say that you have to let people say what is on their minds?  And what is on the minds of unsaved mankind?  Sin is on the minds of sinful man and, therefore, there are requirements that God sets forth if men are to speak as they attempt to minister and share the Word of God with others.  They had better make sure that what they are saying is true and faithful to the Word of God.  That is the only requirement and the people of God must make sure that others stick to that requirement.  I do this same thing on my own page in Facebook.  I do not allow just anyone to post anything.  I will remove it.  I do not care if that is offensive to them.  Personally, I try not to offend, but if the Word of God offends, so be it, and if someone is bringing a lie they are doing as <em>“their father”</em> does because Satan is the father of lies. </p>
